- **Definition:**
  Bellman-Ford Algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted [[Graph]], even when the [[Graph]] contains negative weight edges. It can detect negative weight cycles and is slower than [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]] but more versatile due to its ability to handle negative weights.

- **Key Concepts:**
  1. **[[Graph]] Representation:** The problem is represented as a [[Graph]] where nodes are vertices and connections between nodes are edges, each with a numerical weight.
  
  2. **Relaxation:** The algorithm works by iteratively relaxing edges. Relaxation means checking if a shorter path to a vertex can be found by going through the current vertex being processed.

  3. **Optimal Substructure:** Like [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]], Bellman-Ford builds the shortest path [[tree]] iteratively, one vertex at a time.

- **Steps:**
  1. **Initialization:** [[Set]] the distance to the source vertex as 0 and all other vertices' distances as infinity.
  
  2. **Relaxation:** Iteratively go through all edges and relax them. If a shorter path to a vertex is found, update the distance.
  
  3. **Detection of Negative Cycles:** After the relaxation step, an additional check is made to detect negative weight cycles. If a vertex's distance is updated in the nth iteration, it means there is a negative weight cycle in the [[Graph]].

- **Complexity:**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(V * E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. It must relax all edges V-1 times to guarantee the shortest paths, which takes E iterations in the worst case.
  
  - **Space Complexity:** O(V), as it requires storage space proportional to the number of vertices for distances and parent pointers.

- **Applications:**
  - **Network [[Routing]]:** Used in [[routing]] protocols to find the best path for [[data]] packets in computer networks.
  
  - **Arbitrage Detection:** In finance, it can identify opportunities for arbitrage by detecting negative weight cycles in currency exchange rates.
  
  - **Traffic Engineering:** Helps optimize traffic flow by finding the quickest routes for vehicles, considering traffic congestion.

- **Advantages:**
  - **Handles Negative Weights:** Bellman-Ford can handle graphs with negative weight edges, making it applicable in a wider range of scenarios than [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]].
  
  - **Detects Negative Cycles:** The algorithm can detect the presence of negative weight cycles in the [[Graph]], a valuable feature in certain applications.

- **Limitations:**
  - **Slower than Dijkstra's:** In most cases, Bellman-Ford is slower than [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]], especially for graphs with a large number of edges.
  
  - **Less Efficient:** Its time complexity makes it less efficient for large-scale graphs compared to some other [[algorithms]].
