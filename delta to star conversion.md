## Theorem: Delta to Star Conversion Theorem

The delta to star conversion theorem states that any given delta network can be converted into an equivalent star network using the above conversion equations.

## Example: Delta to Star Conversion

Let's consider an example to illustrate the process of converting a delta network into an equivalent star network.

Given a delta network with [[resistor]] values:
- R1 = 4 Ω
- R2 = 6 Ω
- R3 = 8 Ω

To convert this delta network into an equivalent star network, we can use the conversion equations:

$$Ra = \frac{4 \cdot 6}{4 + 6 + 8} = \frac{24}{18} = \frac{4}{3} Ω$$

$$Rb = \frac{4 \cdot 8}{4 + 6 + 8} = \frac{32}{18} = \frac{16}{9} Ω$$

$$Rc = \frac{6 \cdot 8}{4 + 6 + 8} = \frac{48}{18} = \frac{8}{3} Ω$$

Hence, the equivalent star network has [[resistor]] values:
- Ra = $\frac{4}{3}$ Ω
- Rb = $\frac{16}{9}$ Ω
- Rc = $\frac{8}{3}$ Ω

## Conclusion

Delta to star conversion is a useful technique in electrical circuit analysis to simplify complex [[resistor]] networks. By applying the conversion equations, we can transform a delta network into an equivalent star network. This simplification allows for easier analysis and calculation of circuit properties.
