In the study of electrical circuits, the [[Laplace transform]] is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze the behavior of RLC circuits. RLC circuits consist of a [[resistor]] (R), [[inductor]] (L), and capacitor (C) connected in series or parallel.

## Key Theorems and Definitions

1. **[[Laplace Transform]]**: The [[Laplace transform]] of a function $f(t)$ is defined as:

$$ F(s) = \mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt $$

2. **[[Impedance]]**: In an RLC circuit, the [[impedance]] $Z(s)$ is given by:

$$ Z(s) = R + sL + \frac{1}{sC} $$

3. **[[Node]] Analysis**: [[Node]] analysis is a method used to analyze electrical circuits by applying [[Kirchhoff's Current Law]] at each [[node]].

4. **Mesh Analysis**: Mesh analysis is a method used to analyze electrical circuits by applying Kirchoff's [[voltage]] law around each mesh.

## Step-by-Step Example

Consider an RLC circuit with a [[voltage]] source $V_s$, [[resistor]] $R$, [[inductor]] $L$, and capacitor $C$ connected in series. The [[voltage]] across the capacitor is denoted as $V_c$.

Applying [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]]:

$$ V_s = V_R + V_L + V_c $$

Using [[Ohm's law]] for the [[resistor]], [[inductor]], and capacitor:

$$ V_R = IR, \quad V_L = L\frac{dI}{dt}, \quad V_c = \frac{1}{C}\int I dt $$

Taking the [[Laplace transform]] of the above equations:

$$ V_s(s) = I(s)R + sLI(s) + \frac{I(s)}{sC} $$

Solving for [[current]] $I(s)$:

$$ I(s) = \frac{V_s(s)}{R + sL + \frac{1}{sC}} $$

The [[current]] through the circuit can be found by taking the [[inverse Laplace transform]] of $I(s)$.

By analyzing RLC circuits using Laplace transforms, we can determine the transient and steady-state response of the circuit to different input signals.

By utilizing Laplace transforms, we can simplify complex differential equations that govern RLC circuits into algebraic equations that are easier to solve. This allows for a more efficient analysis and design process in electrical engineering applications.
