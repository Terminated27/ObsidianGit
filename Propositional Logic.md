Propositional logic is a branch of mathematical logic that deals with propositions and their logical relationships. It is concerned with the study of statements or propositions and how they can be combined and evaluated using logical [[operators]].

## Key Concepts and Keywords

- **Proposition**: A statement that is either true or false.
- **[[Logical Operators]]**: Symbols used to combine propositions.
  - **Conjunction (AND)**: denoted by `and`. It returns `True` only if both propositions are `True`.
  - **Disjunction (OR)**: denoted by `or`. It returns `True` if at least one of the propositions is `True`.
  - **Negation (NOT)**: denoted by `not`. It returns the opposite of the proposition.
  - **[[Implication]] (IF...THEN)**: denoted by `if...then`. It returns `False` only if the first proposition is `True` and the second proposition is `False`.
  - **[[Biconditional]] (IF AND ONLY IF)**: denoted by `if and only if`. It returns `True` only if both propositions have the same truth value.
- **Truth Table**: A table that shows all possible combinations of truth values for a given [[set]] of propositions.
- **[[Tautology]]**: A compound proposition that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its components.
- **Contradiction**: A compound proposition that is always false, regardless of the truth values of its components.

## Notation

1. **Negation**: Denoted by the symbol ¬ (not), it takes a single proposition and returns its negation. For example, if p is "It is raining," then ¬p is "It is not raining."

2. **Conjunction**: Denoted by the symbol ∧ (and), it combines two propositions and returns true only if both propositions are true. For example, if p is "It is sunny" and q is "It is warm," then p ∧ q is "It is sunny and warm."

3. **Disjunction**: Denoted by the symbol ∨ (or), it combines two propositions and returns true if at least one of the propositions is true. For example, if p is "It is raining" and q is "It is windy," then p ∨ q is "It is raining or windy."

4. **[[Implication]]**: Denoted by the symbol → (implies), it represents the relationship between two propositions where the truth of the first proposition guarantees the truth of the second proposition. For example, if p is "If it is raining" and q is "then I will take an umbrella," then p → q is "If it is raining, then I will take an umbrella."

5. **[[Biconditional]]**: Denoted by the symbol ↔ (if and only if), it represents a bidirectional relationship between two propositions, where they are either both true or both false. For example, if p is "It is snowing" and q is "It is cold," then p ↔ q is "It is snowing if and only if it is cold."

6. **Exclusive Disjunction (XOR)**: Denoted by the symbol ⊕, it returns true if exactly one of the propositions is true and false otherwise. For example, if p is "It is raining" and q is "It is windy," then p ⊕ q is "It is raining XOR windy," meaning it's either raining or windy but not both at the same time.
