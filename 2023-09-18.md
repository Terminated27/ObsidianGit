on the encoders https://www.martyncurrey.com/connecting-an-photo-interrupter-to-an-arduino/
updated the wiring diagram to be more simple, makes easier to test the phototransistors

what to do next time:
 - make a testing rig, so easy and fast testing the phototrans
 - test motors
 - if get to it, start replaces parts/noting parts need to be replaced
