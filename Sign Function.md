The sign function, denoted as $\text{sgn}(x)$, is a mathematical function that returns the sign of a real number $x$. It is defined as follows:

$$
\text{sgn}(x) = \begin{cases} 
-1 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
0 & \text{if } x = 0 \\
1 & \text{if } x > 0 
\end{cases}
$$

The sign function can also be expressed using the [[Heaviside step function]] $H(x)$:

$$
\text{sgn}(x) = 2H(x) - 1
$$

## Properties of the Sign Function

The sign function possesses several important properties:

**Property 1:** For any real number $x$, $\text{sgn}(x)$ is either $-1$, $0$, or $1$.

**Property 2:** If $x$ is positive, then $\text{sgn}(x) = 1$. If $x$ is negative, then $\text{sgn}(x) = -1$. If $x$ is zero, then $\text{sgn}(x) = 0$.

**Property 3:** The sign function is an odd function, meaning that for any real number $x$, $\text{sgn}(-x) = -\text{sgn}(x)$.

**Property 4:** The [[Derivative]] of the sign function does not exist at $x=0$. However, for any non-zero value of $x$, the [[Derivative]] of $\text{sgn}(x)$ is zero.

## Example: Evaluating the Sign Function

Let's evaluate the sign function for some specific values:

1. $\text{sgn}(-5)$:
   - Since $-5$ is negative, the sign function returns $-1$.

2. $\text{sgn}(0)$:
   - Since $0$ is neither positive nor negative, the sign function returns $0$.

3. $\text{sgn}(7)$:
   - Since $7$ is positive, the sign function returns $1$.

## Theorem: Sign Function and Inequalities

The sign function can be used to simplify and solve inequalities involving real numbers. Consider the following theorem:

**Theorem:** Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers such that $a \neq b$. Then, for any real number $x$, the inequality $ax < bx$ holds if and only if $\text{sgn}(x) = -1$. Similarly, the inequality $ax > bx$ holds if and only if $\text{sgn}(x) = 1$.

**Proof:** 
- Suppose $\text{sgn}(x) = -1$. Then we have two cases:
  1. If $x < 0$, then both sides of the inequality are positive, so it holds.
  2. If $x > 0$, then both sides of the inequality are negative, so it also holds.
- Now suppose $\text{sgn}(x) = 1$. Again, we have two cases:
  1. If $x < 0$, then both sides of the inequality are negative, so it holds.
  2. If $x > 0$, then both sides of the inequality are positive, so it also holds.
- Conversely, if either side of the inequality is zero while the other side is non-zero, then $\text{sgn}(x) = 0$, which contradicts our assumption that $\text{sgn}(x)$ is either $-1$ or $1$.
- Therefore, the theorem holds.

The above theorem can be particularly useful in simplifying and solving inequalities involving algebraic expressions.

In conclusion, the sign function is a mathematical function that returns the sign of a real number. It possesses several important properties and can be used to simplify and solve inequalities. Understanding the sign function is crucial in various mathematical fields, including calculus, algebra, and analysis.
