The damping ratio ($\zeta$) of a second-order linear system can be calculated using the mass ($m$), damping coefficient ($c$), and spring stiffness ($k$) of the system. The damping ratio ($\zeta$) is given by the formula:

$$
\zeta = \frac{c}{2 \sqrt{mk}}
$$

Where:
- $m$ is the mass of the system,
- $c$ is the damping coefficient,
- $k$ is the spring stiffness.

By knowing the values of $m$, $c$, and $k$, you can substitute them into the formula to calculate the damping ratio ($\zeta$). This damping ratio will then allow you to determine whether the system is [[overdamped]], critically damped, or underdamped, as explained in the previous response.
