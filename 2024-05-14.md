## mood today
I felt fine when I woke up, not groggy or anything, even though I slept 3 hours
Was full of energy once I finished the exam, wondering if I was just really relieved. The walk with Keira was great, but I was nervous on the train tracks and got pretty tired after
At the gym I felt great but started to crash at the end
Really felt tired after eating with Keira
Feel really calm at end of day
