# [[Set]] Congruence

In mathematics, [[set]] congruence is a relation between sets in which one [[set]] can be transformed into another by a series of operations such as translations, reflections, rotations, or dilations. Two sets are said to be congruent if there exists a transformation that maps one [[set]] onto the other without changing the shape or size of the sets.

## Key Theorems

1. **Translation Congruence Theorem**: Two sets A and B are congruent if and only if there exists a translation that maps [[set]] A onto [[set]] B.

2. **Rotation Congruence Theorem**: Two sets A and B are congruent if and only if there exists a rotation that maps [[set]] A onto [[set]] B.

3. **Reflection Congruence Theorem**: Two sets A and B are congruent if and only if there exists a reflection that maps [[set]] A onto [[set]] B.

4. **Dilation Congruence Theorem**: Two sets A and B are congruent if and only if there exists a dilation that maps [[set]] A onto [[set]] B.

## Definitions

- Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets in Euclidean space. $A$ is said to be congruent to $B$, denoted as $A \cong B$, if there exists a transformation $T$ such that $T(A) = B$.

- Translation: A transformation that moves each point of a figure the same distance in the same direction.

- Rotation: A transformation that turns each point of a figure around a fixed point by a certain angle.

- Reflection: A transformation that flips each point of a figure over a line called the line of reflection.

- Dilation: A transformation that enlarges or reduces each point of a figure from a fixed center by a scale factor.

## Step-by-step Example

Let's consider two sets $A = \{(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)\}$ and $B = \{(2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7)\}$. We want to determine if these two sets are congruent using translations.

1. Find the translation vector from any point in [[set]] $A$ to its corresponding point in [[set]] $B$: $(x_B - x_A, y_B - y_A)$.
   
   Translation vector: $(2 - 1, 3 - 2) = (1, 1)$.
   
2. Apply this translation vector to all points in [[set]] $A$:
   
   Translated [[set]] $\hat{A} = \{(1+1, 2+1), (3+1, 4+1), (5+1, 6+1)\} = \{(2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7)\}$.
   
3. Check if $\hat{A} = B$. Since $\hat{A} = B$, we conclude that sets $A$ and $B$ are congruent under translation with the given vector $(1, 1)$.

This example demonstrates how we can determine [[set]] congruence using translations between two given sets.
