The [[Thevenin Equivalent Network]] simplifies complex electrical circuits into a single [[voltage]] source ($V_{th}$​) and a single [[resistor]] ($R_{th}$​).
similar to [[Norton Equivalent Network]] 
**How to Find:**

1. **Identify Load:** Choose a part of the circuit where you want to know the equivalent.
2. **Remove Load:** Temporarily take out the component.
3. **Find $V_{th}$:** Calculate the [[voltage]] at the open terminals.
4. **Find $R_{th}$​:** Determine the [[resistance]] looking back into the open terminals with all sources turned off.
