#math #diffeq
ordinary [[Differential Equation]]
How to model
1. need to figure out the relevant variables to the given situation
2. figure out all the related rules
3. choose appropriate units
4. combine the variables and the rules to obtain the ODE
## Example:
found on uploaded notes

### Falling object

### Owls and mice

### a pond initially contains 1 million gallons of water and unknown amount of a chemical
water contains $.02 gram/gal$ of chemical flows into pond at a rate of $200 gal/h$ the mixture flows out at the same rate (pond volume stays the same)
a) write the ODE for $q(t)$: the amount of chemical in the pond ($\frac{dq(t)}{dt}=?$) (reference picture on phone)
$0.02\frac{gram}{gal}*200*\frac{gal}{h}=4\frac{gram}{h}$of chemical moving into the pond
concentration = $\frac{q(t)}{1,000,000}$ , amount in 200 gal is just multiply by 200 gal because gram/gal

## Class of differential EQ
[[ODE]] (ordinary differential) vs [[PDE]] (partial differential)
if the diff eq involves [[partial derivative]] then the diff eq is [[PDE]]
any other diff eq is [[ODE]]

## 3 important questions
1. does there exist a solution
2. if so then if it is unique
3. can we express the solution in [[closed form]]

[[Order]]

[[linear]] vs [[non-linear]]
