**Definition:** Capacitance is a measure of a [[capacitor]]'s ability to store electrical charge when a [[voltage]] difference exists between its plates. It is denoted by the symbol (C) and is measured in Farads (F).

### Formulas
1. **Capacitance (\(C\)) Formula:**$$C = \frac{Q}{V}$$
   Where (C) is the capacitance in Farads ((F)), (Q) is the charge stored on the [[capacitor]] plates in Coulombs ((C)), and (V) is the [[voltage]] across the [[capacitor]] in Volts ((V)).

2. **Capacitance in Terms of Area, Permittivity, and Distance:**$$C = \epsilon_r \times \frac{\epsilon_0 \times A}{d}$$
   Where (C) is the capacitance, ($\epsilon_r$) is the relative permittivity of the dielectric material, ($\epsilon_0$) is the vacuum permittivity (($8.854 times 10^{-12} F/m$)), (A) is the surface area of the plates in square meters (($m^2$)), and (d) is the distance between the plates in meters ((m)).

3. **Time Constant ((tau)) in RC Circuits:**$$\tau = R \times C$$
   Where (tau) is the time constant in seconds ((s)), (R) is the resistance in Ohms (($\Omega$)), and (C) is the capacitance in Farads ((F)).

   
### Key Concepts:

1. **Unit of Measurement:** Capacitance quantifies a [[capacitor]]'s charge-storage capacity. One Farad equals one coulomb of charge stored per volt applied ($F = C/V$).

2. **Formula:** ($C = \frac Q V$), where ($C$) is capacitance, ($Q$) is the charge stored, and ($V$) is the [[voltage]] across the [[capacitor]].

3. **Direct Proportion:** Capacitance is directly proportional to the surface area of the plates and inversely proportional to the distance between them. A larger surface area or a smaller distance results in higher capacitance.

4. **Dielectric Material:** The type of dielectric material between the plates influences capacitance. Higher relative permittivity (($\epsilon_r$)) of the dielectric increases capacitance.

5. **Time Constants:** Capacitance determines the time constant (($\tau = RC$)) in RC circuits, indicating how fast a [[capacitor]] charges or discharges through a [[resistor]] (($R$)).

### Circuit analysis

1. **In Series:**
   - **[[Voltage]] Sharing:** Capacitors in series share the same [[voltage]] drop. In this configuration, the total capacitance ($C_{total}$) is calculated inversely, summing the reciprocals of individual capacitances ($(C_1), (C_2),$ etc.)):   $$\frac{1}{C_{total}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \ldots $$
   - **Charge Sharing:** Capacitors in series share the same charge. The total charge ((Q)) on each [[capacitor]] is the same.

2. **In Parallel:**
   - **[[Voltage]] Sharing:** Capacitors in parallel have the same [[voltage]] across their terminals. The total capacitance in this arrangement is the sum of individual capacitances: $$C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 + \ldots $$
   - **Charge Sharing:** The charge on each [[capacitor]] is determined by its capacitance (($C_i$)) and the [[voltage]] ((V)) applied across the parallel combination: $$Q_i = C_i \times V$$

3. **With Resistors (RC Circuits):**
   - **Charging and Discharging:** In RC circuits, capacitors and resistors interact during charging and discharging. The [[voltage]] across the [[capacitor]] (($V_c$)) changes over time ((t)) according to the formula: $$V_c(t) = V \times (1 - e^{-\frac{t}{RC}})$$ where (V) is the initial [[voltage]], (R) is the resistance, (C) is the capacitance, and ([[e]]) is the mathematical constant (~2.718).

4. **With Inductors (RLC Circuits):**
   - **Resonance:** In RLC circuits, capacitors interact with inductors to create resonant circuits. At the resonant frequency, capacitors and inductors exchange [[energy]] efficiently, leading to resonance phenomena.

5. **With Diodes (Rectifier Circuits):**
   - **Smoothing:** [[Capacitor]]s in rectifier circuits smooth out the pulsating DC output by storing charge during peak [[voltage]] and discharging during lower [[voltage]] periods. This action converts pulsating DC to a more stable DC [[voltage]].

Understanding these interactions is crucial for circuit analysis and designing electronic circuits for specific functionalities, such as filtering, amplification, and timing control.
