The **Frequency Response Function (FRF)** is a key concept in the analysis of continuous time signals and systems. It provides a way to understand how a system responds to different frequencies of input signals. The FRF is defined as the ratio of the output spectrum to the input spectrum of a linear time-invariant system.

The FRF is denoted by $H(j\omega)$, where $\omega$ represents the frequency of the input signal. The magnitude and [[phase]] of $H(j\omega)$ provide important information about how the system responds to different frequencies.

## Key Theorems

1. **Bode's Gain-[[Phase]] Relationship**: Bode's gain-[[phase]] relationship states that the magnitude and [[phase]] of the FRF are related in a logarithmic manner. This relationship is crucial for understanding how a system behaves at different frequencies.

2. **Nyquist Stability Criterion**: The Nyquist stability criterion uses the FRF to determine the stability of a system by analyzing its frequency response in the complex plane.

## Examples

### Example 1: Calculation of Frequency Response Function

Consider a simple RC circuit with [[transfer function]] $H(s) = \frac{1}{1+sRC}$. To find the FRF $H(j\omega)$, we substitute $s = j\omega$ into the [[transfer function]]:

$$
H(j\omega) = \frac{1}{1+j\omega RC}
$$

### Example 2: Bode Plot Analysis

Given an FRF $H(j\omega) = \frac{100}{(1+j\omega)(1+0.1j\omega)}$, we can plot its magnitude and [[phase]] using Bode plots to analyze how the system responds to different frequencies.

By delving into these key concepts and examples, we gain a deeper understanding of how Frequency Response Functions play a crucial role in analyzing continuous time signals and systems.
