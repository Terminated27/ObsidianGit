- A [[super node]] is a technique in circuit analysis used to simplify the analysis of electrical circuits.
- It combines two or more regular [[node|nodes]] in a circuit, typically when there's a [[voltage]] source connected between them.
- By treating these nodes as a single entity, [[super node]]s simplify the equations required to find [[voltage]]s and currents in complex circuits.

### method
Using [[Node Method]] you can combine a [[Voltage Source]] or [[Current Source]] into 2 nodes with a known difference from each other

next define a ground to get a known 0 V / 0 A [[node]]

use [[node method]] to solve
