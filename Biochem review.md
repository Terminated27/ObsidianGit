### Proline, glycine, tyrosine, and cysteine are special amino acids for various reasons:

1. Proline: Proline is unique because it has a secondary amino group bonded to its side chain, which forms a ring structure. This ring structure restricts the flexibility of the peptide backbone and can disrupt the regular alpha-helix or beta-sheet structures found in proteins. Proline is commonly found in turns and loops of protein structures.

2. Glycine: Glycine is the smallest amino acid with a hydrogen atom as its side chain. Its small size allows it to fit into tight spaces in protein structures, making it important for maintaining proper protein folding and stability. Glycine is also highly flexible due to its lack of a side chain, allowing it to adopt different conformations within a protein.

3. Tyrosine: Tyrosine is special because it contains a phenol group in its side chain, which allows it to participate in hydrogen bonding interactions and contribute to the stabilization of protein structures. Tyrosine is also involved in various signaling pathways as a precursor for important molecules like thyroid hormones and neurotransmitters.

4. Cysteine: Cysteine is unique because it contains a thiol group (-SH) in its side chain, which can form disulfide bonds with other cysteine residues in proteins. Disulfide bonds play a crucial role in stabilizing protein structures and are important for maintaining the overall shape and function of many proteins. Cysteine residues are often found in regions of proteins that require structural stability or are involved in redox reactions.

### peptide bond = ncc bond

### at low ph, acidic amino acids are  protonated with a neutral charge on their ionizable group
at low ph, basic amino acids are protonated with a positive charge on their ionizable group. why

At low pH, the environment is acidic, which means there are an abundance of hydrogen ions present. These hydrogen ions can interact with the ionizable group of basic amino acids, causing them to lose a proton and become deprotonated. This results in a positive charge on the amino acid, as it has lost a negatively charged proton.


### Common functional groups from the 4 different categories of amino acids

non polar
- hydrocarbons CH3
polar
- hydroxls OH
- SH
- 
acidic
COOH / COO-
basic
- amines
- amides
- NH2 / NH3

### difference between domains vs subunits in a protein

subunit. single poly peptide chain, domain - a section of that chain that have a specific function

Homotetrameric refers to a protein complex or structure composed of four identical subunits. In other words, all four subunits in the complex are the same and have identical amino acid sequences. This type of structure is common in many proteins and enzymes, allowing for specific functions and interactions within the biological system.

whats a domain in a protein
found with the protein sequence bar, each box is a domain


### different model types
ribbon model shows secondary structure
stick and ball model shows R groups
Space filling shows Vander walls force
Backbone model shows backbone

### Ramachandran plot

beta plated sheets denoted by arrows in the ribbon model


### 3 types of secondary structures

1. Alpha helix: In an alpha helix, the polypeptide chain is twisted into a right-handed coil, with hydrogen bonds forming between the carbonyl oxygen of one amino acid and the amide hydrogen of an amino acid four residues down the chain.

2. Beta sheet: In a beta sheet, the polypeptide chain forms a zigzag pattern, with adjacent strands running in opposite directions. Hydrogen bonds form between the carbonyl oxygen of one strand and the amide hydrogen of an adjacent strand.

3. Beta turn/ coil: A beta turn, also known as a reverse turn or reverse bend, is a type of secondary structure that reverses the direction of the polypeptide chain. This allows for tight packing in proteins and helps to stabilize their overall structure.

### a secondary structure is the H bonds in the backbone

### Protein with nonpolar residues on exterior
will be hydrophobic and likely to interact with other hydrophobic molecules or surfaces. This can lead to the formation of protein aggregates or the binding of the protein to lipid membranes. <--- Molecular chaperones
becuaase they dont like water, and in aqueous solution, they are forced together

### Hydrophobic effect
the hydrophobic molecules will clump together in water
because they are repelled by water molecules and are more attracted to each other. This causes them to form clusters or aggregates in order to minimize their contact with water. This phenomenon is known as hydrophobic interactions. due to entropy

protein wants to find its lowest energy state, so it folds and hides the hydrophobic sides to keep the entropy of the water high

### most likely to be a part of amphipathic beta plated sheet
amphipathic - must have polar and nonpolar parts (one side is polar and one side is nonpolar) (must be alternating because they scrunch like an accordion to form the 2 sides)

### least likely to be part of alpha helix
poline, glycine -  helix breaker
poline - too rigid
glycine - too flexible

### most likely to be found on exterior of protein
lots of polar molecules

### most likely to be on the interior
lots of nonpolar molecules

### H bonds stabilize protein structure
### anti parallel beta sheets are more stable, they have difficulty sliding against each other

### PrP (prion protein)misfolds because it is a low energy state that is possible, it is the lowest relative state, and it needs to gain energy to refold
chaperones wont refold it because the beta sheet aggregates so much theres no room for the chaperone to come in

prions are not typical misfolded proteins that can be refolded by chaperones. Prions are infectious, self-replicating proteins that can induce other normal proteins to misfold and become prions themselves. This makes them particularly difficult to refold using traditional methods.

### Cystic Fibrosis
it is a mutation that causes mucus to be too thick, and not clear correctly (CFTR detetion mutation (chloride channel)) chlorides help break down the mucus


### Types of mutations
give a short list of possible gene mutations with a 1 sentence description like missense deletion addition nonsense and silent

1. Frameshift mutation: Insertion or deletion of nucleotides that shifts the reading frame of a gene, resulting in a nonfunctional protein.
2. Splice site mutation: Alteration of the consensus sequences at intron-exon junctions, leading to incorrect splicing and potentially abnormal protein production.
3. Duplication mutation: Replication of a segment of DNA, resulting in an extra copy of a gene or genes.
4. Inversion mutation: Reversal of the orientation of a segment of DNA within a chromosome, potentially disrupting gene function.
5. Translocation mutation: Movement of a segment of DNA from one chromosome to another, potentially causing gene fusion or disruption.

### separate protein
YUNG-1 from cell lysate (bunch of cells) it is heterodimeric large protein with many lysine residues has Kd (K of dissasociation) of $1.2*10^4$ to antibody EF
ion exchange because lots of basic residues, so positive charge
size exclusion chromatography because large protein
affinity chromatography large Kd number so low affinity, if large Ka number then possible
2D gel is possible because of lots of lysine residues 

### how to number of subunits in protein
reduce SDS Page (only breaks ncl interactsions)
adding denaturing agents (detergents) DTT (breaks disulifde bonds)

 Acidic - negative charge Bacic - positive charge


### Ran functions
Importin - transport molecule that brings cargo into the nucleus, leaves when bound to ran GTP
Ran - GTP - G protein that binds importin to release its cargo, helps exportin leave the nucleus
Ran - GEF - Guanosine exchange factor, exchanges GDP to GTP
Ran - GAP - GTAse hydrolyze ran GTP to ran GDP
Ran - GDP - off conformation hydrolyze version of ran GTP brought back using NTF2
NTF2 - molecule that brings ran GDP back into nucleus
Exportin - helps export cargo from nucleus when bound to ran GTP

### the mitochondrial sequence is found on the N terminus
N term translated first, its important to recognize the peptide before it starts folding
### molecular chaperones use ATP to bind peptides with mitochondrial import sequences to prevent folding

### transmembrane proteins are created in the ER

### translocators are necessary for mitochondrial transportation
they are named
TOM TIM  = translocator outer membrane andt translocator inner membrane

## nonpolar amino acids are found in the signal binding packed of SRP
the ER signal sequence has a lot of nonpolar amino acids, so must also be nonpolar to be able to recieve
### the ER is trafficking highway, different endpoints
the golgi apparatus ( secretes the proteins to their final endpoint)(sometimes adds glycans(markers))
Transmembrane
ER retention ( usually need another sequence for it to stay)
