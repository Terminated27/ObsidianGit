- A **[[linear circuit]]** follows **[[Ohm's Law]]**, exhibiting a direct relationship between **[[voltage]]** and **[[current]]** for components like resistors.
- Linear circuits are characterized by **[[linear components]]**, such as resistors, which obey [[Ohm's Law]].
- They enable predictable analysis through principles like **[[superposition]]** and techniques like **[[Thevenin's theorem]]**.
- [[Nonlinear components]] like diodes and transistors don't follow [[Ohm's Law]] and are not part of [[linear circuit]]s.
