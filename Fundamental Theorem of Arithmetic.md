The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive integer greater than 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors. This theorem is a fundamental concept in number theory and plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of integers.

## Theorem Statement
Every positive integer $n > 1$ can be expressed as:
$$ n = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{a_k}, $$
where $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ are prime numbers and $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ are positive integers.

## Uniqueness
The factorization of a positive integer into prime factors is unique up to the order of the factors. In other words, if we have two different prime factorizations for a number $n$, then they must be equivalent after reordering the factors.

## Example
Let's consider the number 60. To express it as a product of primes:
$$ 60 = 2^2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1. $$

This shows that 60 can be uniquely represented as a product of primes according to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is essential in various areas of mathematics, such as cryptography and number theory. It provides a foundational understanding of how integers can be decomposed into their prime components, allowing for further exploration and analysis in these fields.
