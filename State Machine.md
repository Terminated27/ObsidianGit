[[Regular Expressions]]
A state machine is a mathematical model used to describe the behavior of a system. It consists of a [[set]] of states, transitions between these states, and actions associated with each transition. State machines are widely used in software development to model complex systems and control their behavior.

## Key Concepts and Keywords

- **State**: A condition or situation that a system can be in.
- **Transition**: A change from one state to another triggered by an event or condition.
- **Event**: An input or trigger that causes a transition between states.
- **Action**: A specific task or behavior associated with a transition.
- **State Diagram**: A graphical representation of a state machine, showing states, transitions, and events.

## Example: Traffic Light State Machine

Let's consider an example of a traffic light state machine implemented in [[Python]]. This state machine has three states: "Green", "Yellow", and "Red". The transitions are triggered by a timer and change the light color accordingly.

```python
class TrafficLight:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = "Red"
        
    def change_state(self):
        if self.state == "Red":
            self.state = "Green"
        elif self.state == "Green":
            self.state = "Yellow"
        elif self.state == "Yellow":
            self.state = "Red"
            
    def get_state(self):
        return self.state
    
# Usage
traffic_light = TrafficLight()
print(traffic_light.get_state())  # Output: Red
traffic_light.change_state()
print(traffic_light.get_state())  # Output: Green
```

In this example, we define a `TrafficLight` [[class]] representing the state machine. The initial state is set to `"Red"`. The `change_state` method changes the light color based on the current state. Finally, we have a `get_state` method to retrieve the current state.

## Example: Vending Machine State Machine

Let's consider another example of a vending machine state machine implemented in [[Python]]. This state machine has four states: "Idle", "Selection", "Payment", and "Dispense". The transitions are triggered by user actions such as selecting an item, making a payment, and dispensing the item.

```python
class VendingMachine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = "Idle"
        
    def select_item(self):
        if self.state == "Idle":
            self.state = "Selection"
        else:
            print("Invalid action!")
            
    def make_payment(self):
        if self.state == "Selection":
            self.state = "Payment"
        else:
            print("Invalid action!")
            
    def dispense_item(self):
        if self.state == "Payment":
            self.state = "Dispense"
        else:
            print("Invalid action!")
            
    def get_state(self):
        return self.state
    
# Usage
vending_machine = VendingMachine()
print(vending_machine.get_state())  # Output: Idle
vending_machine.select_item()
print(vending_machine.get_state())  # Output: Selection
vending_machine.make_payment()
print(vending_machine.get_state())  # Output: Payment
vending_machine.dispense_item()
print(vending_machine.get_state())  # Output: Dispense
```

In this example, we define a `VendingMachine` [[class]] representing the state machine. The initial state is set to `"Idle"`. The methods `select_item`, `make_payment`, and `dispense_item` handle the transitions between states based on user actions. The `get_state` method retrieves the current state.

## Conclusion

State machines provide a powerful way to model complex systems and control their behavior. By defining states, transitions, and actions, we can represent the different possible scenarios and ensure that the system behaves correctly. [[Python]], with its flexibility and object-oriented features, allows us to implement state machines efficiently.
