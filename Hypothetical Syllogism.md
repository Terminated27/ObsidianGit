Hypothetical syllogism is a fundamental logical principle that allows us to draw conclusions from conditional statements. It is based on the logical form "If A, then B" and the principle of transitivity. In this atomic note, we will explore the key theorems, definitions, and step-by-step examples related to hypothetical syllogism.

## Theorem: Hypothetical Syllogism

The hypothetical syllogism states that if we have two conditional statements, and the conclusion of the first statement matches the hypothesis of the second statement, then we can conclude a new conditional statement.

Formally, if we have:

1. $A \implies B$
2. $B \implies C$

Then we can conclude:

3. $A \implies C$

This theorem allows us to chain together multiple conditional statements and draw logical conclusions from them.

## Example 1

Let's consider an example to illustrate how hypothetical syllogism works.

Given:

1. If it is raining ($R$), then the ground is wet ($W$): $R \implies W$
2. If the ground is wet ($W$), then there are puddles ($P$): $W \implies P$

We can use hypothetical syllogism to conclude:

3. If it is raining ($R$), then there are puddles ($P$): $R \implies P$

In this example, we used the first two conditional statements to derive a new conditional statement using hypothetical syllogism.

## Example 2

Let's consider another example to further understand hypothetical syllogism.

Given:

1. If it is sunny ($S$), then I will go for a walk ($W$): $S \implies W$
2. If I go for a walk ($W$), then I will feel refreshed ($R$): $W \implies R$

Using hypothetical syllogism, we can conclude:

3. If it is sunny ($S$), then I will feel refreshed ($R$): $S \implies R$

In this example, we again used the first two conditional statements to derive a new conditional statement using hypothetical syllogism.

## Conclusion

Hypothetical syllogism is a powerful logical principle that allows us to draw conclusions from conditional statements. By chaining together multiple conditional statements, we can derive new conditional statements. This principle is essential in mathematical proofs and reasoning, enabling us to establish logical connections between different statements.
