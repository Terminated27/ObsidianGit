The [[integral]] from $0$ to $\infty$ represents an improper [[integral]] in calculus. It's equivalent to the limit of a definite [[integral]] as the upper limit approaches infinity. Mathematically, for a function $f(t)$, the [[integral]] from $0$ to $\infty$ is denoted as:

$$ \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t) \, dt = \lim_{A \to \infty} \int_{0}^{A} f(t) \, dt $$

In other words, it represents the area under the curve of $f(t)$ from $t = 0$ to $t = A$ as $A$ becomes infinitely large. If this limit exists and is finite, the [[integral]] from $0$ to $\infty$ is said to converge, and it has a specific numerical value. If the limit does not exist or is infinite, the [[integral]] is said to diverge, indicating that the area under the curve is unbounded.
