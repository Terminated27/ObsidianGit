# Equivalence Classes

Equivalence classes are a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in the field of abstract algebra. 

## Definition

Given a [[set]] $X$ and an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$, the equivalence class of an element $a \in X$ is defined as:

$$ [a] = \{ x \in X : x \sim a \} $$

In other words, the equivalence class of $a$ consists of all elements in $X$ that are equivalent to $a$ under the relation $\sim$.

## Key Theorems

1. **Partition Theorem**: Equivalence classes form a partition of the [[set]] $X$, meaning that they are pairwise disjoint and their union covers the entire [[set]] $X$.
  
2. **Equivalence Class Theorem**: For any two elements $a,b \in X$, either their equivalence classes are identical or they are disjoint.

## Step-by-Step Example

Consider the [[set]] $X = \mathbb{Z}$ (integers) and define an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ such that for any two integers $a,b$, we say $a \sim b$ if $a - b$ is divisible by 5.

1. **Equivalence Class of 0**: The equivalence class of 0 is given by:

$$ [0] = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \sim 0 \} = \{ ...,-10,-5,0,5,10,...\} $$

2. **Equivalence Class of 1**: The equivalence class of 1 is:

$$ [1] = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \sim 1\} =\{ ...,-9,-4,1,6,11,...\} $$

3. **Partition Property**: The equivalence classes form a partition of $\mathbb{Z}$, as every integer belongs to exactly one equivalence class.

Equivalence classes provide a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing structures in mathematics, particularly in areas such as group theory and ring theory.
