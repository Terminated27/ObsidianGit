## Introduction
Algorithm efficiency is an important concept in computer science and programming. It refers to the measure of how well an algorithm performs in terms of time and space requirements. Understanding algorithm efficiency is crucial for writing high-[[performance]] code. This atomic note will cover key concepts related to algorithm efficiency, provide relevant examples, and highlight important keywords.

## [[Big O Notation]]
[[Big O notation]] is commonly used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of a function that represents the time or space complexity of an algorithm. The notation is expressed as `O(f(n))`, where `f(n)` represents the function that describes the growth rate.

### Examples:
- `O(1)`: Constant time complexity. The algorithm takes a constant amount of time regardless of the input size.
- `O(n)`: Linear time complexity. The algorithm's execution time grows linearly with the input size.
- `O(n^2)`: Quadratic time complexity. The algorithm's execution time grows quadratically with the input size.

## Time Complexity
Time complexity measures how much time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is when dealing with large datasets.

### Examples:
1. Constant Time Complexity (`O(1)`):
```python
def print_first_element(lst):
    print(lst[0])

# Regardless of list size, this function always prints the first element in constant time.
```

2. Linear Time Complexity (`O(n)`):
```python
def find_max(lst):
    max_val = lst[0]
    for num in lst:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val

# As the list size increases, this function takes proportionally more time to find the maximum value.
```

3. Quadratic Time Complexity (`O(n^2)`):
```python
def print_pairs(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):
            print(lst[i], lst[j])

# The number of pairs printed grows quadratically with the list size, resulting in longer execution time.
```

## Space Complexity
Space complexity measures how much memory an algorithm requires as a function of the input size. It helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is when dealing with limited memory resources.

### Examples:
1. Constant Space Complexity (`O(1)`):
```python
def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# This function uses a constant amount of memory to store the two input numbers and the result.
```

2. Linear Space Complexity (`O(n)`):
```python
def create_list(n):
    lst = []
    for i in range(n):
        lst.append(i)
    return lst

# The size of the list created grows linearly with the input value n, resulting in increased space usage.
```

3. Quadratic Space Complexity (`O(n^2)`):
```python
def create_matrix(n):
    matrix = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(n):
            row.append(i * j)
        matrix.append(row)
    return matrix

# The size of the matrix created grows quadratically with the input value n, resulting in higher memory usage.
```
