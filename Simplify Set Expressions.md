# Simplify [[Set]] Expressions

## Introduction
In [[set]] theory, it is often necessary to simplify [[set]] expressions in order to better understand their properties and relationships. This atomic note will provide a step-by-step guide on how to simplify [[set]] expressions using various operations such as union, intersection, and complement. We will also discuss key theorems and definitions related to [[set]] simplification.

## Union of Sets
The union of two sets A and B, denoted by $A \cup B$, is the [[set]] that contains all elements that are in A or in B (or both). To simplify a union expression, we need to identify any duplicate elements and remove them.

**Example 1:** Simplify the expression $(A \cup B) \cup C$.

Solution:
- First, we expand the expression: $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup B \cup C$.
- Next, we remove any duplicate elements from the union: $A \cup B \cup C$.

Therefore, $(A \cup B) \cup C$ simplifies to $A \cup B \cup C$.

## Intersection of Sets
The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by $A \cap B$, is the [[set]] that contains all elements that are in both A and B. To simplify an intersection expression, we need to identify common elements between sets.

**Example 2:** Simplify the expression $(A \cap B) \cap C$.

Solution:
- First, we expand the expression: $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap B \cap C$.
- Next, we find common elements between sets:
  - If an element belongs to all sets involved in the intersection, it remains in the simplified expression.
  - If an element does not belong to any one of the sets involved in the intersection, it is removed from the simplified expression.

Therefore, $(A \cap B) \cap C$ simplifies to $A \cap B \cap C$.

## Complement of Sets
The complement of a [[set]] A, denoted by $A'$ or $\overline{A}$, is the [[set]] that contains all elements that are not in A. To simplify a complement expression, we need to find the elements that are not in the given [[set]].

**Example 3:** Simplify the expression $(A \cup B)'$.

Solution:
- First, we expand the expression: $(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B'$.
- Next, we find the complement of each [[set]]:
  - The complement of A contains all elements that are not in A.
  - The complement of B contains all elements that are not in B.

Therefore, $(A \cup B)'$ simplifies to $A' \cap B'$.

## Distributive Laws
The distributive laws for sets allow us to simplify expressions involving unions and intersections. There are two distributive laws:

1. Union distributes over intersection: $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$.
2. Intersection distributes over union: $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$.

**Example 4:** Simplify the expression $A \cup (B \cap C)$ using the distributive law.

Solution:
- Using the distributive law, we can rewrite the expression as $(A \cup B) \cap (A\cup C)$.
- Next, we simplify further if possible.

Therefore, $A \cup (B\cap C)$ simplifies to $(A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C)$ using the distributive law.

## Conclusion
Simplifying [[set]] expressions involves removing duplicate elements, finding common elements, and identifying complements. The distributive laws for sets can also be used to simplify expressions involving unions and intersections. By following these steps and using the appropriate [[set operations]], we can simplify [[set]] expressions to better understand their properties and relationships.
