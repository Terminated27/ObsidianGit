 A [[hash function]] is a mathematical function that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a digest that appears random. The key property of a hash function is that even a small change in the input will produce a significantly different output, known as the avalanche effect.

**Common Uses:**

1. **Data Integrity:** [[Hash function]]s ensure data integrity by generating unique [[Hash]]es for unique data sets. If the data changes, the [[Hash]] changes, indicating potential tampering.
2. **Password Storage:** [[Hash function]]s store passwords securely by converting them into [[Hash]]es, making it difficult for attackers to retrieve the original passwords from the [[Hash]] values.
3. **Data Retrieval:** [[Hash function]]s are used in [[data structure]]s like [[hash table]]s, allowing quick data retrieval based on the hash value, improving efficiency.
4. **Digital Signatures:** [[Hash function]]s play a crucial role in digital signatures, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of digital messages.
