The complex conjugate of a complex number is an important concept in complex analysis. It is denoted by adding a bar over the number. For a complex number $z = a + bi$, its complex conjugate is denoted as $\bar{z} = a - bi$.

## Properties of Complex Conjugate

1. The conjugate of the sum of two [[complex numbers]] is equal to the sum of their conjugates:
   $$\overline{z_1 + z_2} = \bar{z_1} + \bar{z_2}$$

2. The conjugate of the difference between two [[complex numbers]] is equal to the difference between their conjugates:
   $$\overline{z_1 - z_2} = \bar{z_1} - \bar{z_2}$$

3. The conjugate of the product of two [[complex numbers]] is equal to the product of their conjugates:
   $$\overline{z_1 \cdot z_2} = \bar{z_1} \cdot \bar{z_2}$$

4. The conjugate of the quotient between two [[complex numbers]] is equal to the quotient between their conjugates:
   $$\overline{\left(\frac{{z_1}}{{z_2}}\right)} = \frac{{\bar{z_1}}}{{\bar{z_2}}}$$

5. The modulus (or absolute value) squared of a complex number $z$ is equal to the product of $z$ and its conjugate:
   $$|z|^2 = z \cdot \bar{z}$$

## Applications and Examples

### Example 1: Finding the Complex Conjugate
Let's find the complex conjugate for $w = 3 + 4i$.

The complex conjugate of $w$ is $\bar{w} = 3 - 4i$.

### Example 2: Simplifying Expressions
Simplify the expression $\frac{{(2 + i)(1 - i)}}{{(3 + 4i)(3 - 4i)}}$.

First, let's simplify the numerator:
$$(2 + i)(1 - i) = 2 - 2i + i - i^2 = 2 - i + 1 = 3 - i$$

Next, let's simplify the denominator using the difference of squares:
$$(3 + 4i)(3 - 4i) = 9 - (4i)^2 = 9 - (-16) = 9 + 16 = 25$$

Therefore, the simplified expression is:
$$\frac{{(2 + i)(1 - i)}}{{(3 + 4i)(3 - 4i)}} = \frac{{3 - i}}{{25}}$$

### Example 3: Proving a Theorem
Prove that for any complex number $z$, $z \cdot \bar{z}$ is always a non-negative real number.

Let $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Then, the conjugate of $z$ is $\bar{z} = a - bi$. The product of $z$ and its conjugate is:
$$z \cdot \bar{z} = (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2$$

Since both $a^2$ and $b^2$ are non-negative real numbers, their sum $a^2 + b^2$ is also a non-negative real number. Therefore, for any complex number $z$, $z \cdot \bar{z}$ is always a non-negative real number.

## Conclusion

The concept of complex conjugate is essential in complex analysis. It has various properties that allow us to simplify expressions, prove theorems, and perform calculations involving [[complex numbers]]. Understanding the properties and applications of complex conjugates is crucial in many areas of mathematics and engineering.
