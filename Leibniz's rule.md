Leibniz's rule, also known as the Leibniz [[integral]] rule or the differentiation under the [[integral]] sign, is a method for differentiating integrals that depend on a parameter. It provides a way to compute the [[derivative]] of an [[integral]] with respect to a parameter without explicitly differentiating under the [[integral]] sign.

## Statement of Leibniz's Rule

Let $f(x,t)$ be a function of two variables $x$ and $t$, where $x$ lies in the interval $[a,b]$ and $t$ lies in the interval $[c,d]$. If both $f(x,t)$ and its partial derivative $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$ are continuous functions on the rectangle defined by these intervals, then we have:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\int_{a}^{b} f(x,t)dx\right) = \int_{a}^{b} \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(x,t)dx
$$

This means that we can differentiate an [[integral]] with respect to its parameter by simply differentiating the integrand with respect to that parameter.

## Example

Let's consider an example to illustrate how Leibniz's rule can be applied.

Suppose we have the following [[integral]]:

$$
I(t) = \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \sin(tx)dx
$$

We want to find $\frac{dI}{dt}$ using Leibniz's rule.

Using Leibniz's rule, we can differentiate under the [[integral]] sign:

$$
\frac{dI}{dt} = \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\sin(tx))dx
$$

Differentiating $\sin(tx)$ with respect to $t$ gives:

$$
\frac{dI}{dt} = \int_{0}^{\pi/2} x\cos(tx)dx
$$

Now, we can evaluate this [[integral]] to obtain the final result.

## Conclusion

Leibniz's rule provides a powerful technique for differentiating integrals with respect to a parameter. It allows us to avoid explicitly differentiating under the [[integral]] sign and simplifies the differentiation process. This rule has wide applications in various branches of mathematics and physics, particularly in solving differential equations involving integrals.
