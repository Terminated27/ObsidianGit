   - **Formula:** \(P = VI\)
     - Where \(P\) is the [[power]] in [[watts]] (W),
     - \(V\) is the [[voltage]] in volts (V),
     - \(I\) is the [[current]] in amperes (A).

**2. [[Power]] in Resistive Circuits:**
   - **Formula:** \(P = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}\)
     - Where \(P\) is the [[power]] in [[watts]] (W),
     - \(I\) is the [[current]] in amperes (A),
     - \(R\) is the resistance in ohms (Î©),
     - \(V\) is the [[voltage]] in volts (V).

**3. [[Power]] in AC Circuits (Using RMS Values):**
