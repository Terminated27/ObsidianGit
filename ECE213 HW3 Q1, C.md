Sure, I'd be glad to help you work through this integral! We're dealing with an integral of a product involving the [[Dirac delta function]], $\delta(\tau - t + 10)$. The property of the delta function you need to remember here is essentially its sifting property, which extracts the value of the function multiplied by it when its argument is zero. More formally, for any function $f(\tau)$, this property is defined as:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau) \delta(\tau - a) d\tau = f(a),$$

provided the [[integration]] interval includes the point where the delta function's argument is zero, i.e., $\tau = a$.

Given your integral, $\int_{4}^{5} \tau \delta(\tau - t + 10) d\tau$, let's apply this concept. We need to find the value of $\tau$ that makes the argument of the delta function zero, as this is where the "action" of the delta function happens.

Set the argument of the delta function to zero to find the relevant $\tau$:  $\tau - t + 10 = 0 \implies \tau = t - 10$

For the delta function to contribute to the integral, $\tau = t - 10$ must lie within the [[integration]] limits, which are $\tau=4$ to $\tau=5$. This means that for the integral to be non-zero, $t - 10$ must be within the interval $[4, 5]$, or more precisely, the delta function "activates" only if $4 \leq t - 10 \leq 5$. Solving for $t$, we find $14 \leq t \leq 15$. If $t$ does not lie in this range, the integral evaluates to zero because the delta function does not fall within the [[integration]] limits.

Given the sifting property, if $14 \leq t \leq 15$, the integral simplifies to evaluating the function $\tau$ at $\tau = t - 10$, so you get:

$$ \int_{4}^{5} \tau \delta(\tau - t + 10) d\tau = \begin{cases} t - 10 & \text{if } 14 \leq t \leq 15 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$
 
This means the integral evaluates to $t - 10$ for $t$ in the range $[14, 15]$ and is $0$ otherwise, capturing the essence of how the [[Dirac delta function]] interacts with the [[integration]] process.
To express the integral using a [[step function]], let's denote the [[step function]] as $u(t)$. The integral can be rewritten as:

$$ \int_{4}^{5} \tau \delta(\tau - t + 10) d\tau = (t - 10)u(t - 14)u(15 - t) $$

Here, $u(t - 14)$ represents the [[step function]] that becomes 1 when $t \geq 14$, and $u(15 - t)$
represents the [[step function]] that becomes 1 when $t \leq 15$. So, the rewritten function is:

$$ \begin{cases} t - 10 & \text{if } 14 \leq t \leq 15 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

- If (t \leq 0), $$ \int_{-\infty}^{0} e^{-9j\tau} \delta(\tau - 4t) d\tau = e^{-36jt} $$$$\frac{\sin\left(-\frac{3}{8} - t\right)}{8} $$
