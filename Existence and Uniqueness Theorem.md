Let P(t), Q(t), and R(t) be continuous functions on an [[open interval]] $I$ containing the point $t=t_0$. Then, for any [[initial condition]]s $y(t_0)=y_0$​ and $y'(t_0)=y'_0$​, there exists a unique solution y(t) to the second-order linear [[ODE]]

$$a(t)\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}+b(t)\frac{dy}{dt}+c(t)y = 0$$

on the interval $I$ that satisfies the given initial conditions $y(t_0)=y_0$​ and $y'(t_0)=y'_0$​,.

This theorem essentially states that under certain conditions on the coefficients a(t), b(t), and c(t) (namely, their continuity), there exists a unique solution to the initial value problem for [[second order linear ODE]]s. The theorem ensures the existence of a solution as well as its uniqueness, meaning that there cannot be multiple different solutions that satisfy the same [[initial condition]] within the given interval.
