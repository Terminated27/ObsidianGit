Identifying the configuration of an [[op-amp]] circuit involves understanding the arrangement of input and output connections and the placement of passive components like resistors and capacitors. Here are the common [[op-amp]] configurations and how to identify them:

### 1. **Inverting Amplifier:**
**Characteristics:**
- The input signal is applied to the inverting (-) terminal.
- There is a [[resistor]] connected between the inverting terminal and the output.
- There is no direct connection between the non-inverting terminal and the input signal.

**Identification:**
- If the input is connected to the inverting (-) terminal and there is a [[resistor]] between the inverting terminal and the output, it's an inverting amplifier.

### 2. **Non-Inverting Amplifier:**
**Characteristics:**
- The input signal is applied to the non-inverting (+) terminal.
- There is a [[resistor]] connected between the non-inverting terminal and the output.
- There is no direct connection between the inverting terminal and the input signal.

**Identification:**
- If the input is connected to the non-inverting (+) terminal and there is a [[resistor]] between the non-inverting terminal and the output, it's a non-inverting amplifier.

### 3. **Differential Amplifier:**
**Characteristics:**
- There are two input signals, one applied to the inverting (-) terminal and another to the non-inverting (+) terminal.
- The output is the amplified difference between the two input signals.

**Identification:**
- If there are two input signals, one connected to the inverting (-) terminal and another to the non-inverting (+) terminal, it's a differential amplifier.

### 4. **Summing Amplifier:**
**Characteristics:**
- There are multiple input signals connected through resistors to the inverting terminal.
- The output is the weighted sum of the input signals.

**Identification:**
- If there are multiple input signals, each connected to the inverting (-) terminal through individual resistors, it's a summing amplifier.

### 5. **Integrator:**
**Characteristics:**
- There is a capacitor connected between the output and the inverting terminal.
- The input signal is usually applied to the inverting terminal.

**Identification:**
- If there is a capacitor connected between the output and the inverting (-) terminal, and the input signal is applied to the inverting terminal, it's an integrator.

By recognizing these characteristics and analyzing the connections between the [[op-amp]] terminals and external components, you can identify the configuration of an [[op-amp]] circuit.
