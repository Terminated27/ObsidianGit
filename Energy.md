**Energy in Circuits:**

Energy in electrical circuits is a fundamental concept, representing the capacity to do [[work]] or cause change. Understanding and calculating energy in circuits are vital for various applications, from designing efficient systems to ensuring safe operation. Here are key points and formulas related to energy in circuits:

1. **Electrical Energy (E):**
   - **Formula:** $E = P \times t$
     - Where $E$ is the electrical energy in joules (J),
     - $P$ is the [[power]] in [[watts]] (W),
     - $t$ is the time in seconds (s).

2. **Energy in DC Circuits:**
   - **Formula:** $E = V \times I \times t$
     - Where $E$ is the electrical energy in joules (J),
     - $V$ is the [[voltage]] in volts (V),
     - $I$ is the [[current]] in amperes (A),
     - $t$ is the time in seconds (s).

3. **Energy in AC Circuits:**
   - For AC circuits, energy calculations often involve [[root mean square]] (RMS) values of [[voltage]] ($V_{\text{rms}}$) and [[current]] ($I_{\text{rms}}$):
   - **Formula:** $E = V_{\text{rms}} \times I_{\text{rms}} \times \cos(\theta) \times t$
     - Where $E$ is the electrical energy in joules (J),
     - $V_{\text{rms}}$ is the RMS [[voltage]] in volts (V),
     - $I_{\text{rms}}$ is the RMS [[current]] in amperes (A),
     - $\theta$ is the [[phase angle]] difference between [[voltage]] and [[current]] waveforms,
     - $t$ is the time in seconds (s).

4. **Energy Stored in Capacitors:**
   - **Formula:** $E = \frac{1}{2} C \times V^2$
     - Where $E$ is the energy stored in joules (J),
     - $C$ is the [[capacitance]] in farads (F),
     - $V$ is the [[voltage]] across the [[capacitor]] in volts (V).

5. **Energy Stored in Inductors:**
   - **Formula:** $E = \frac{1}{2} L \times I^2$
     - Where $E$ is the energy stored in joules (J),
     - $L$ is the inductance in Henries (H),
     - $I$ is the [[current]] through the [[inductor]] in amperes (A).

Understanding these energy-related concepts and formulas is essential for engineers and technicians working with electrical circuits, enabling efficient use of energy and effective circuit design.
