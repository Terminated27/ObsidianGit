In computer science and programming, a **node** is a fundamental [[data structure]] used to store and organize [[data]] in various types of [[data structure]]s, such as [[linked lists]], [[tree]], graphs, and [[hash table]]s. A [[node]] consists of two main components:

1. **[[Data]]:** [[Nodes]] store the actual [[data]] or value associated with the node. This [[data]] could be of any [[data]] type, including integers, strings, objects, or even complex structures.

2. **Pointers/References:** Nodes contain one or more pointers or references to other nodes in memory. These pointers establish relationships between nodes, defining the structure of [[data storage]].

**Key Concepts:**

1. **[[Linked Lists]]:** In the context of [[linked lists]], a node typically contains a [[data]] element and a reference to the next node in the list. The last node's reference is set to null (or None in [[Python]]) to indicate the end of the list.

2. **[[tree]] and Graphs:** In [[tree]] and [[Graph]] [[data structure]]s, a node contains [[data]] and references to its child nodes or adjacent nodes, respectively. [[tree]], especially [[binary search tree]]s, often have a left child pointer, a right child pointer, and a pointer to the parent node.

3. **Graphs:** In graphs, nodes (also known as vertices) store data, and edges are represented as connections between nodes. Each node may have pointers to other nodes that it is connected to in the [[Graph]].

4. **[[Hash Table]]s:** In [[hash table]]s, nodes are used to store [[key-value pair]]s. Each node contains a key, its associated value, and a pointer to the next node in case of collisions (when multiple keys hash to the same index).

**Operations on Nodes:**

- **Creation:** Nodes are created dynamically in memory, often using constructors in object-oriented programming languages.
  
- **Traversal:** Nodes are traversed sequentially to access and manipulate the stored data. This is a fundamental operation in many data structures.

- **Modification:** Data within a node can be modified or updated as needed during the execution of a program.

- **Deletion:** Nodes can be removed or deleted from data structures. In [[linked lists]], for example, deleting a node involves updating the pointers of the surrounding nodes to bypass the node to be deleted.

- **Connection/Pointers:** Establishing and managing connections between nodes (pointers/references) is crucial for creating complex data structures and [[algorithms]].

**Conclusion:**

Nodes serve as the building blocks for various [[data]] structures, enabling the creation of sophisticated [[algorithms]] and efficient storage mechanisms. Understanding nodes and their relationships is fundamental for every programmer dealing with [[data]] manipulation and algorithm design.
