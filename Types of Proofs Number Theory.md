In number theory, various [[types of proofs]] are used to demonstrate the properties and relationships of integers. Some common [[types of proofs]] in number theory include:

1. **Direct Proof**: This type of proof involves starting with the given hypothesis and using logical deductions to arrive at the desired conclusion. For example, to prove that the sum of two even integers is even, we can use a direct proof by considering two even integers $2n$ and $2m$, where $n$ and $m$ are integers.

   $$2n + 2m = 2(n + m)$$

   Since $n + m$ is an integer, the sum is also even.

2. **Indirect Proof (Proof by Contradiction)**: In this type of proof, we assume the negation of the statement we want to prove and show that it leads to a contradiction. For example, to prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, we assume that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational and derive a contradiction.

3. **Proof by Contrapositive**: This type of proof involves proving the contrapositive statement instead of the original statement. For example, to prove that if $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even, we can prove the contrapositive statement: if $n$ is not even, then $n^2$ is not even.

4. **Proof by Mathematical Induction**: This type of proof is used to prove statements about natural numbers by first showing that the statement holds for a base case (usually $n=1$) and then proving that if it holds for some arbitrary integer $k$, it also holds for $k+1$. For example, to prove that the sum of the first $n$ positive integers is $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, we can use mathematical induction.

5. **Proof by Cases**: In this type of proof, different cases are considered separately to establish a result. For example, when proving properties about divisibility or congruence [[modulo]] a number, different cases may need to be considered based on remainders.

These are just a few examples of the [[types of proofs]] commonly used in number theory. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the specific problem being addressed. By mastering these proof techniques, mathematicians can explore and uncover new insights into the fascinating world of number theory.
