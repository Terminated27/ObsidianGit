The Kleene star, denoted by $A^*$, is a fundamental concept in formal language theory and [[regular expressions]]. It represents the [[set]] of all possible concatenations of zero or more instances of the language represented by $A$. 

## Definition
For a language $A$, the Kleene star $A^*$ is defined as:
$$ A^* = \{ w_1w_2...w_n | n \geq 0, w_i \in A \text{ for } 1 \leq i \leq n\} $$

## Key Theorem
One of the key properties of the Kleene star is that for any language $A$, $(A^*)^* = A^*$.

## Example
Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the concept of Kleene star. 
Given $A = \{a, b\}$, then $A^* = \{\epsilon, a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa,...\}$ where $\epsilon$ represents the empty string.

By understanding the properties and applications of Kleene star, we can effectively manipulate and describe regular languages in formal language theory.
