# [[Integral]] of Time-Shifted Impulse Function

The [[integral]] of a time-shifted impulse function can be represented mathematically as follows:

Given an impulse function $\delta(t)$ and a time shift $t_0$, the [[integral]] of the time-shifted impulse function is given by:

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-t_0) dt = 1 $$

This result can be understood by considering the properties of the impulse function and its time shift. The impulse function has an area under the curve equal to 1, regardless of any time shifts applied to it. Therefore, integrating a time-shifted impulse function over its entire domain will still yield a result of 1.

### Example:

Let's consider an example where we have a time-shifted impulse function defined as $\delta(t-2)$. 

The [[integral]] of this time-shifted impulse function over its entire domain is given by:

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-2) dt $$

Since the area under the curve of the impulse function is always 1, regardless of any time shifts, the result of this [[integral]] will also be 1.

Therefore, 

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-2) dt = 1 $$

This property is useful in signal processing and system analysis, where [[convolution]] with impulse functions plays a crucial role in understanding system behavior.
