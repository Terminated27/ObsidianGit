In time systems, linear constant coefficient difference equations play a crucial role in modeling discrete-time systems. These equations are of the form:

$$
a_n y[n] + a_{n-1} y[n-1] + \ldots + a_1 y[n-k] = b_0 x[n]
$$

where $y[n]$ is the output signal, $x[n]$ is the input signal, and $a_i$ and $b_0$ are constants.

## Key Theorems and Definitions

### Theorem 1: Homogeneous Solution

The homogeneous solution of a linear constant coefficient difference equation is given by:

$$
y_h[n] = C_1 r_1^n + C_2 r_2^n + \ldots + C_k r_k^n
$$

where $r_i$ are the roots of the characteristic equation associated with the difference equation.

### Theorem 2: Particular Solution

The particular solution of a linear constant coefficient difference equation can be found using methods like undetermined coefficients or variation of parameters.

## Step-by-Step Example

Consider the linear constant coefficient difference equation:

$$
y[n] - 0.5y[n-1] = x[n]
$$

### Step 1: Find the Homogeneous Solution

The characteristic equation is:

$$
r - 0.5 = 0 \implies r = 0.5
$$

Thus, the homogeneous solution is:

$$
y_h[n] = C(0.5)^n
$$

### Step 2: Find the Particular Solution

Assume a particular solution of the form $y_p[n] = A$. Substituting into the difference equation, we get:

$$
A - 0.5A = x[n] \implies A = \frac{1}{0.5}x[n]
$$

Therefore, the particular solution is $y_p[n] = 2x[n]$.

### Step 3: [[General Solution]]

The [[general solution]] is given by combining the homogeneous and particular solutions:

$$
y[n] = y_h[n] + y_p[n] = C(0.5)^n + 2x[n]
$$

By understanding linear constant coefficient difference equations in time systems, we can analyze and design discrete-time systems effectively.
