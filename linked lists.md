- [[Linked lists]] are data structures composed of nodes, where each [[node]] contains data and a reference (or link) to the next [[node]] in the sequence.
- They come in various forms, including singly [[linked lists]] (each [[node]] points to the next), doubly [[linked lists]] (each [[node]] points to both the next and previous nodes), and circular [[linked lists]].
- [[Linked lists]] allow for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions and deletions but have slower random access times compared to [[array|arrays]].
