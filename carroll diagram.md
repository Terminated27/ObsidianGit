A Carroll diagram is a visual tool used in mathematics to classify objects based on their properties. It consists of a grid with labeled categories and objects placed in the appropriate cells of the grid. This diagram helps organize information and identify patterns or relationships between different objects.

## Definition

A Carroll diagram is a two-dimensional grid used to categorize objects based on one or more properties.

## Example

Let's consider a [[set]] of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. We want to categorize these numbers based on whether they are odd or even and whether they are prime or composite.

We can create a Carroll diagram with two categories for odd and even numbers and two categories for prime and composite numbers:

|        | Odd   | Even   |
| ------ | ----- | ------ |
| Prime  |       |        |
| Composite |       |        |

Now we can place the numbers in the appropriate cells of the diagram:

|        | Odd   | Even   |
| ------ | ----- | ------ |
| Prime  |   3   |    -   |
| Composite |   -   |    -   |

In this example, we have identified that the number 3 is both odd and prime. The other numbers are either odd and composite or even.

## Theorems

### Theorem 1: Every integer is either odd or even.

Proof: Let's consider an arbitrary integer $n$. By definition, an even number can be expressed as $2k$ for some integer $k$, while an odd number can be expressed as $2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, every integer can be classified as either odd or even.

### Theorem 2: A prime number is not divisible by any other number except itself and one.

Proof: Let's consider an arbitrary prime number $p$. If $p$ is divisible by any number other than itself and one, then it would not be a prime number. Therefore, a prime number is not divisible by any other number except itself and one.

## Conclusion

Carroll diagrams provide a visual representation of how objects can be classified based on their properties. They help identify patterns and relationships between different objects, making it easier to understand and analyze data. By using Carroll diagrams, we can organize information effectively and gain insights into various mathematical concepts.
