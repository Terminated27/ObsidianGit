In number theory, uniqueness plays a crucial role in determining the properties and relationships between numbers. Here, we explore the concept of uniqueness in various contexts within number theory.

## Unique Factorization Theorem

The Unique Factorization Theorem states that every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
n = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_k^{a_k}
$$

where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers and $a_i$ are positive integers.

## Example: Unique Factorization

Let's consider the number $36$. We can express $36$ as:

$$
36 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2
$$

This representation is unique up to the order of the factors.

## Chinese Remainder Theorem

The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is another important result in number theory that guarantees the existence and uniqueness of solutions to systems of congruences. Given a system of congruences:

$$
x \equiv a_1 \pmod{m_1} \\
x \equiv a_2 \pmod{m_2} \\
\vdots \\
x \equiv a_k \pmod{m_k}
$$

where $m_i$ are pairwise [[coprime]], the CRT asserts that there exists a unique solution [[modulo]] $M = m_1 \cdot m_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot m_k$.

## Example: Chinese Remainder Theorem

Consider the system of congruences:

$$
x \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \\
x \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
$$

By applying CRT, we find that the unique solution [[modulo]] $15$ is $8$.

## Conclusion

Uniqueness in number theory provides us with powerful tools to understand and manipulate integers in various contexts. Whether it be prime factorization or solving systems of congruences, uniqueness forms the foundation for many key results in number theory.
