To calculate the [[energy]] (E) of a signal represented by a graph of a function (x(t)), you typically follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Signal's Expression

If the graph doesn't come with an explicit mathematical expression, you'll need to deduce it based on the shape and characteristics of the signal within distinct intervals. For piecewise functions, identify each segment's functional form within specified intervals.

### Step 2: Define the [[Energy]] Formula

The [[energy]] (E) of a continuous-time signal is given by:

$$E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x(t)|^2 dt$$

For discrete-time signals represented graphically, [[energy]] would instead be calculated by a summation:

$$E = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} |x[n]|^2$$

### Step 3: Apply the Formula to Each Segment (if necessary)

If your signal is piecewise or consists of multiple distinct functional forms over different intervals, calculate the [[energy]] for each segment where the signal is non-zero, then sum those energies if necessary. For a single, continuous expression, you can apply the [[integral]] over the entire domain where the function is defined or non-zero.

### Step 4: Perform the [[Integration]] or Summation

- For continuous signals, integrate (|x(t)|^2) over the relevant range. This might involve solving the [[integral]] analytically if possible, or numerically if the function is complex or doesn't have an elementary antiderivative.
- For discrete signals, perform the summation across all values of (n) where (x[n]) is defined or non-zero.

### Step 5: Handling Non-Standard Graphs

- **Piecewise Functions**: Carefully examine the graph for changes in the function's behavior and calculate the [[energy]] for each piece separately.
- **Signals with Symmetry**: Use properties of symmetry to reduce the computation. For even functions ((x(t) = x(-t))), you can integrate from 0 to infinity and multiply by 2, if the signal is finite and symmetrical.
- **Limited Time Range**: If the signal exists for a finite period, only integrate or sum over this range.

Sure! Let's calculate the [[energy]] of the signal represented by the function x(t) over the intervals [-5, 0] and [0, 8].

Given:
- For t in [-5, 0]: x(t) = 7
- For t in [0, 8]: x(t) = (1/2)t - 4

### Step 1: Identify the Signal's Expression

The signal x(t) is piecewise defined as above.

### Step 2: Define the [[Energy]] Formula

The [[energy]] (E) of a continuous-time signal is given by:

$$E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x(t)|^2 dt$$

### Step 3: Apply the Formula to Each Segment

We have two segments:
1. For t in [-5, 0]: x(t) = 7
2. For t in [0, 8]: x(t) = (1/2)t - 4

### Step 4: Perform the [[Integration]]

1. For t in [-5, 0]:
$$E_1 = \int_{-5}^{0} |7|^2 dt$$
$$E_1 = \int_{-5}^{0} 49 dt$$
$$E_1 = [49t]_{-5}^{0}$$
$$E_1 = (0 - (-245))$$
$$E_1 = 245$$

2. For t in [0, 8]:
$$E_2 = \int_{0}^{8} |\frac{1}{2}t -4|^2 dt $$
$$E_2 = \int_{0}^{8} (\frac{1}{4}t^2 -4t +16) dt $$
$$E_2 = [\frac{1}{12}t^3 -2t^2 +16t]_{0}^{8} $$
$$E_2 = (\frac{512}{3}-128+128)-(0)=\frac{512}{3}$$. 

### Step 5: Total [[Energy]] Calculation

The total [[energy]] of the signal over both intervals is:
Total [[Energy]] E= E1 + E2=245+512/3=921/3+512/3=1433/3â‰ˆ477.67
