1. Diffeq in form $\frac{dy}{dt}=ay+b$
as $t->\infty$ converge at $y=\frac{13}{12}$ 
$y'=-12y+13$
2. Diffeq in form $\frac{dy}{dt}=ay+b$
as $t->\infty$ diverge at $y=7$
$y'=y-7$

plug in test values to find directions of field

notice the converge and divergent points, use same technique as Q1,2
$y'=y(-y+7)$

$6-\frac q{3000000}*200$
6 because that is the amount that comes in per hour regardless of the pound condition
$\frac{q}{3000000}$ because that is the [[current]] concentration in the pond that is coming out
$*200$ because the fraction is 1 gallon of water, and it is flowing out at 200 gal an hr
![[Pasted image 20230913111928.png]]
90000 because the concentration in the pond will eventually be the concentration coming in, and if .03g/gal then mult by 3 mil
doesnt matter on input because it converges
