Theorem 26 [[existence and uniqueness theorem]] for first order [[Linear Differential]]

if the functions P and q are continuous on an [[open interval]] I, $\alpha < t < \beta$ containing the point $t=t_0$ then [[there exists]] a [[unique]] solution ($\exists !$) = $e(t)$ that satisfies the [[ODE]]
$y'+P(t)y=q(t)$ $Vt\in I$
$y(0)=y_0$ $\leftarrow$ [[initial condition]]
[[Existence Theorem]] [[Uniqueness Theorem]]
theorem 29 existence and uniqueness of [[first order ODE]]

let the function f and [[Partial Derivative]] $\frac{\partial d}{\partial y}$ be continuous in some rectangle $\alpha < t < \beta$ containing the point ($t_0,y_0$) then in some interval $t_0-h<t<t_0+h$ contained in $\alpha < t < \beta$ of the [[initial condition|initial value problem]] 


[[Linear Differential]]

$ty'+2y=4t^2$ $y(1)=2$
solution $\Rightarrow$ $y(t)=t^2+\frac1{t^2}$
there exists solutions where the function is defined
interval of $\exists \ne 0$ 


take [[Partial Derivative]] of y' and observe when both functions are continuous
