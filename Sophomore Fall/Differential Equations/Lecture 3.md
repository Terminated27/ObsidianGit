[[Linear Differential]] and  method of [[Integrating Factor]]
last time $\frac{dy}{dt}=ay+b=a(y+b/a)$
another way
$y'-ay=b$
mult by $e^{-at}=e^{-at}y'-aye^{-at}=be^{-at}$
some moving around to get and [[integral|integrating]] to get $y=-\frac{b}{a}+ce^{-at}$
e^{-at} is the [[Integrating Factor]]
ay-b = b/a Ce^{at}
