A [[linked list]] is a fundamental [[data structure]] in computer science and programming. Unlike arrays, [[linked lists]] do not require contiguous memory locations. Instead, they consist of nodes, each containing data and a reference (or link) to the next [[node]] in the sequence. This structure allows dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertions, deletions, and provides a flexible way to store and manipulate data.
