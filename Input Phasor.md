In the context of continuous time signals, an input phasor represents a sinusoidal signal with a specific frequency and [[phase]]. It is often used in signal processing to analyze and manipulate signals in the frequency domain.

## Key Theorems and Definitions

1. **Phasor Representation**: A phasor can be represented as $A \angle \theta$, where $A$ is the amplitude and $\theta$ is the [[phase angle]].
  
2. **[[Euler's Formula]]**: [[Euler's formula]] relates complex numbers to trigonometric functions and is given by $e^{j\theta} = \cos(\theta) + j\sin(\theta)$.

3. **Phasor Addition**: When adding two phasors $A_1 \angle \theta_1$ and $A_2 \angle \theta_2$, the result is $A_r \angle \theta_r$, where $A_r = \sqrt{A_1^2 + A_2^2 + 2A_1A_2\cos(\theta_1 - \theta_2)}$ and $\theta_r = \arctan\left(\frac{A_1\sin(\theta_1) + A_2\sin(\theta_2)}{A_1\cos(\theta_1) + A_2\cos(\theta_2)}\right)$.

## Step-by-Step Example

Consider two input phasors: $V_{in1} = 5\angle 30^\circ$ V and $V_{in2} = 3\angle -45^\circ$ V. To find the resultant phasor when these two are added:

$$
V_{in} = V_{in1} + V_{in2}
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
V_{in} = 5\angle 30^\circ + 3\angle -45^\circ
$$

Calculate the resultant phasor using the phasor addition formula:

$$
V_{in} = \sqrt{5^2 + 3^2 + 2(5)(3)\cos(30^\circ - (-45)^\circ)} \angle (\arctan(...))
$$

Solving for $V_{in}$ gives us the final phasor representing the combined input signals.

By understanding input phasors and their manipulation, we can effectively analyze and process continuous time signals in various applications.
