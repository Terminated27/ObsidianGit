Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a [[Neurodevelopmental Disorder]] characterized by persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. It is one of the most common childhood disorders, affecting approximately 5-7% of children and 2-5% of adults worldwide. ADHD is typically diagnosed in childhood and can persist into adulthood.

## Diagnostic Criteria

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive type, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, and combined type. To be diagnosed with ADHD, an individual must exhibit at least six symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity for at least six months. These symptoms must also be present before the age of 12 and must impair daily functioning in two or more settings (e.g. home, school, work).

## Key Symptoms

### Inattention
- Difficulty paying attention to details or making careless mistakes
- Trouble staying focused on tasks or activities
- Easily distracted by external stimuli
- Forgetfulness in daily activities
- Difficulty organizing tasks or belongings
- Avoidance or dislike of tasks that require sustained mental effort

### Hyperactivity/Impulsivity
- Fidgeting or squirming in seat
- Difficulty remaining seated when expected to do so
- Excessive talking or interrupting others
- Difficulty waiting for turn in conversations or games
- Impulsive decision-making without considering consequences

## Neurobiological Basis

Research suggests that ADHD is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Studies have identified several genes associated with ADHD, particularly those involved in dopamine signaling pathways. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in reward-motivated behavior and executive functioning.

Additionally, structural and functional differences have been observed in the brains of individuals with ADHD compared to those without the disorder. These differences are most prominent in the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions such as attention, planning, and impulse control.

## Treatment Options

There is no cure for ADHD, but symptoms can be managed with a combination of medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. Stimulant medications such as methylphenidate and amphetamines are commonly prescribed to improve attention and reduce hyperactivity/impulsivity. Non-stimulant medications like atomoxetine and guanfacine may also be used.

Behavioral therapy can help individuals with ADHD develop coping strategies and improve social skills. Parent training programs can also be beneficial in managing a child's behavior at home.

## Controversies

There is ongoing debate about the overdiagnosis and overmedication of ADHD, particularly in children. Some argue that the diagnostic criteria for ADHD are too broad and may lead to misdiagnosis or unnecessary treatment. Others argue that ADHD is a legitimate disorder that requires proper diagnosis and treatment.

## Conclusion

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects both children and adults. It is characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that can significantly impact daily functioning. While there is no cure for ADHD, effective treatment options are available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life for those affected by this disorder.
