the Taylor series or [[Taylor expansion]] of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's [[Derivative]] at a single point.

used to approximate the actual function without knowing the general function

general form $$\sum^\infty _{n=0} \frac{f^n(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$$
n! = factorial of n
a = real/complex number
$f^n(a)$ = nth [[derivative]] of f evaluated at the point a
