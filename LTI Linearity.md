# LTI Linearity

In the field of signal processing, Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems play a crucial role. These systems have the property of linearity, which allows us to analyze and manipulate them using powerful mathematical tools. In this atomic note, we will explore the concept of LTI linearity in detail.

## Definition

An LTI system is said to be linear if it satisfies two important properties: [[superposition]] and scaling.

1. **[[Superposition]] AKA: Additivity**: If an input signal x(t) produces an output signal y(t), and another input signal z(t) produces an output signal w(t), then for any constants a and b, the input signal ax(t) + bz(t) will produce an output signal ay(t) + bw(t).

2. **Scaling**: If an input signal x(t) produces an output signal y(t), then for any constant a, the input signal ax(t) will produce an output signal ay(t).

These properties can be mathematically expressed as follows:

$$
\text{Superposition:} \quad T[ax_1(t)+bx_2(t)] = aT[x_1(t)] + bT[x_2(t)]
$$

$$
\text{Scaling:} \quad T[ax(t)] = aT[x(t)]
$$

where $T[\space]$ denotes the operation performed by the LTI system on the input signal.

## Implications of Linearity

The linearity property has several important implications that make it a powerful tool for analyzing and designing LTI systems.

### 1. Response to Simple Signals

Since any complex input can be represented as a combination of simpler signals using [[superposition]], analyzing how an LTI system responds to simple signals provides insights into its behavior with more complicated inputs.

For example, consider two input signals x₁(t) and x₂(t), which produce output signals y₁(t) and y₂(t), respectively. By understanding the system's response to these individual signals, we can determine its response to any linear combination of them.

### 2. [[Convolution]] Property

Linearity plays a fundamental role in the [[convolution]] property of LTI systems. The output of an LTI system to the [[convolution]] of two input signals is equal to the [[convolution]] of the system's responses to each input signal individually.

Mathematically, if x₁(t) and x₂(t) are two input signals with respective responses y₁(t) and y₂(t), then the response of the LTI system to their [[convolution]] x₁(t) * x₂(t) is given by:

$$
T[x_1(t) * x_2(t)] = T[x_1(t)] * T[x_2(t)] = y_1(t) * y_2(t)
$$

where * denotes [[convolution]].

### 3. [[Transfer Function]] Analysis

The linearity property allows us to analyze LTI systems using transfer functions. The [[transfer function]] H(s) represents the relationship between the [[Laplace transform]] of an input signal X(s) and the [[Laplace transform]] of its corresponding output signal Y(s).

For an LTI system with [[impulse response h(t)]], the [[transfer function]] H(s) is obtained by taking the [[Laplace transform]] of h(t):

$$
H(s) = \mathcal{L}\{h(t)\}
$$

By applying linearity, we can compute the output Y(s) for any input X(s) using:

$$
Y(s) = X(s)\cdot H(s)
$$

where · denotes multiplication.

## Example

Consider an LTI system with [[impulse response h(t)]]. Let's say we have an input signal x₁(t), which produces an output signal y₁(t). Similarly, another input signal x₂(t) produces an output signal y₂(t). We want to find the response of the system to an input signal x(t) = 3x₁(t) - 2x₂(t).

Using the linearity property, we can compute the output signal y(t) as follows:

$$
y(t) = T[x(t)] = T[3x₁(t) - 2x₂(t)] \\
= 3T[x₁(t)] - 2T[x₂(t)] \\
= 3y₁(t) - 2y₂(t)
$$

Thus, the response of the LTI system to the input signal x(t) is given by 3y₁(t) - 2y₂(t).

## Conclusion

The linearity property of LTI systems is a powerful concept that allows us to analyze and manipulate signals using mathematical tools. By satisfying [[superposition]] and scaling, LTI systems exhibit several important implications such as response analysis, [[convolution]] property, and [[transfer function]] analysis. Understanding these properties helps in designing and understanding complex systems in various fields including communication, control, and image processing.
