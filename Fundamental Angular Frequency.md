The fundamental angular frequency, denoted as $\omega_0$, is a key concept in the study of oscillatory systems. It is defined as the lowest possible frequency at which a system can oscillate.

## Definition

In simple terms, the fundamental angular frequency represents the rate at which an oscillating system completes one full cycle. Mathematically, it is given by the formula:

$$\omega_0 = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$

where $\omega_0$ is the fundamental angular frequency and $T$ is the period of oscillation.

## Key Theorems

### Theorem 1: Relationship between Frequency and Angular Frequency

The relationship between frequency $f$ and angular frequency $\omega$ is given by:

$$\omega = 2\pi f$$

This theorem highlights that angular frequency is directly proportional to frequency.

### Theorem 2: Relationship between Angular Frequency and Period

The relationship between angular frequency $\omega$ and period $T$ is given by:

$$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$

This theorem shows that angular frequency is inversely proportional to the period of oscillation.

## Step-by-Step Example: Simple Pendulum

Let's consider a simple pendulum consisting of a mass $m$ attached to a string of length $L$. The motion of the pendulum can be approximated as simple harmonic motion, with its period given by:

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$

where $g$ represents acceleration due to gravity.

To find the fundamental angular frequency $\omega_0$, we can use the formula:

$$\omega_0 = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$

Substituting the expression for $T$, we have:

$$\omega_0 = \frac{2\pi}{2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$$

Hence, the fundamental angular frequency of a simple pendulum is given by $\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$.

## Conclusion

The fundamental angular frequency is a fundamental concept in the study of oscillatory systems. It represents the lowest possible frequency at which a system can oscillate. By understanding the relationship between angular frequency, period, and frequency, we can analyze various oscillatory systems and gain insights into their behavior.
