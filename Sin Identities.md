**1. Reciprocal Identity:**
$$\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}$$
The cosecant (\(\csc\)) of an angle is the reciprocal of its sine value.

**2. Pythagorean Identity:**
$$\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$$
This fundamental identity shows the relationship between sine and cosine squared values in a right triangle with a hypotenuse of length 1.

**3. Even-Odd Identities:**
$$\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$$
Sine function is an odd function, meaning its [[Graph]] is symmetric about the origin.
$$\sin(\pi - \theta) = \sin(\theta)$$
Sine function is also periodic with period \(2\pi\).

**4. Cofunction Identities:**
$$\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \cos(\theta)$$
Sine and cosine are complementary functions.

$$\csc\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \sec(\theta)$$
Cosecant and secant are complementary functions.

**5. Double Angle Identity:**
$$\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)$$
Expresses the sine of a double angle in terms of the original angle.

**6. Addition and Subtraction Identities:**
$$\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)$$
$$\sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)$$
Useful for finding the sine of the sum or difference of two angles.

**7. Half-Angle Identity:**
$$\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(\theta)}{2}}$$
This identity expresses sine of half an angle in terms of cosine.

**8. Product-to-Sum Identities:**
$$\sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) = \frac{1}{2}[\cos(\alpha - \beta) - \cos(\alpha + \beta)]$$
$$\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) = \frac{1}{2}[\cos(\alpha - \beta) + \cos(\alpha + \beta)]$$
Useful for expressing products of sines and cosines as sums.

Understanding these identities is fundamental in trigonometry, enabling simplification of complex expressions, solving equations, and analyzing periodic phenomena in various fields of science and engineering.
