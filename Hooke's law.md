**Atomic Note: Hooke's Law**

**Definition:**  
Hooke's Law is a fundamental principle in physics and engineering that states the relationship between the force applied to a material and the resulting deformation or elongation of that material. It is named after the 17th-century English scientist Robert Hooke, who first described this behavior.

**Mathematical Representation:**  
$$ F = -k \times x $$

Where:
- $F$ represents the force applied to the material (in Newtons, N).
- $k$ is the stiffness or spring constant of the material (in Newtons per meter, N/m).
- $x$ is the resulting deformation or elongation of the material from its original position (in meters, m).
