"Please create an atomic note on {{title}}. Format the content in Markdown, but use LaTeX exclusively for equations. Surround inline equations with $ on either side and display equations with $$. Include key theorems, definitions, and step-by-step examples related to the topic. Please do not reintroduce already known topics, and focus on providing additional insights and depth. Keep the discussion strictly related to the specified topic and use appropriate mathematical expressions in LaTeX format. Thank you."
