## Closed-Loop [[Transfer Function]] $Q(s)$

The closed-loop [[transfer function]] $Q(s)$ in control systems is defined as the ratio of the output signal $Y(s)$ to the input signal $X(s)$ in the [[Laplace domain]]. It represents the relationship between the input and output signals when feedback is present in the system.

The expression for $Q(s)$ can be written as:

$$ Q(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} $$

### Key Theorems and Definitions

1. **Closed-Loop [[Transfer Function]]**: The closed-loop [[transfer function]] relates the input and output signals of a control system with feedback.

2. **Feedback System**: A system where a portion of the output signal is fed back to the input to modify the system's behavior.

### The closed-loop [[transfer function]] $Q(s)$ can be expressed as:

$$ Q(s) = \frac{H(s)}{1 + G(s)H(s)} $$
