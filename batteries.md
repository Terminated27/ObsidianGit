when in series, add [[voltage]], [[Amp-Hour]] stays the same
when in parallel, [[voltage]] doesn't change. add [[Amp-Hour]]
an ideal battery is a [[Voltage Source]]


total [[charge]] = [[current]] * time
if more than 1 battery in line with not identical voltages

$V^-=0$
$V=0-(4)-(3)+(2)$
when going into a "+", subtract [[voltage]], when "-", add
