Unsupervised learning is a [[machine learning]] technique where the model learns patterns and relationships in the [[data]] without any labeled examples or explicit guidance. It is often used for exploratory [[data]] analysis, [[Clustering]], and dimensionality reduction. In this atomic note, we will explore unsupervised learning in the context of a [[Python]] advanced programming class.

## Key Concepts and Keywords

- Unsupervised Learning: A [[machine learning]] technique where the model learns patterns and relationships in the [[data]] without labeled examples.
- [[Clustering]]: Grouping similar [[data]] points together based on their characteristics.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features or variables in a dataset while preserving important information.
- [[K-means Clustering]]: A popular algorithm for partitioning data into k clusters based on similarity.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A technique for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional data by finding new uncorrelated variables called principal components.

## Clustering with K-means

[[K-means clustering]] is a commonly used unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions [[data]] into k clusters based on similarity. Each cluster has a centroid that represents its center. Here's an example of how to perform [[k-means clustering]] using scikit-learn library in [[Python]]:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Create an instance of KMeans with 3 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)

# Fit the model to the data
kmeans.fit(data)

# Get cluster labels for each data point
labels = kmeans.labels_

# Get cluster centroids
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_
```

In this example, `data` represents your dataset. After fitting the model to the [[data]], `labels` will contain cluster labels assigned to each [[data]] point, and `centroids` will contain coordinates of cluster centroids.

## Dimensionality Reduction with PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional [[data]] by finding new uncorrelated variables called principal components. It can be useful for visualizing and understanding complex datasets. Here's an example of how to perform PCA using scikit-learn library in [[Python]]:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Create an instance of PCA with 2 components
pca = PCA(n_components=2)

# Fit the model to the data
pca.fit(data)

# Transform the data to the new coordinate system
transformed_data = pca.transform(data)
```

In this example, `data` represents your dataset. After fitting the model to the [[data]], `transformed_data` will contain the transformed data in a lower-dimensional space.

## Conclusion

Unsupervised learning is a powerful technique for exploring and analyzing datasets without labeled examples. [[Clustering]] with k-means allows us to group similar data points together, while dimensionality reduction with PCA helps us visualize and understand complex datasets. By utilizing these techniques in [[Python]], we can gain valuable insights from our data and make informed decisions.
