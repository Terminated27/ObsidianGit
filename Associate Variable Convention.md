states that there are variables are associated
if you change one the other must change
their references are associated
1. the first step is to define your references, what you will be looking at and measuring across
2. write down the applicable formulas
3. plug in and solve the formulas

if [[Power]] is > 0 [[energy]] flows into system
if [[Power]] is < 0 [[energy]] flows out of system


# Examples
## Example 1

![[Pasted image 20230915094023.png]]

$i=i_1+i_2$
$i_1=10A$ because goes thru the [[current]] supply
$i_2=\frac VR$ because does not go thru [[current]] supply

## Example 2
![[Pasted image 20230915095221.png]]
only applies to [[Resistor]] network
$P=\frac{v^2}R$
$i^2*R$
