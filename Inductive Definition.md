In a Computing & number theory class, inductive definition is a method used to define sets or functions by specifying base cases and rules for generating new elements or values based on previously defined ones. This technique is commonly used in mathematical proofs and computer science to establish properties of recursively defined objects.

## Key Concepts:

- **Base Case**: The initial element or value that serves as the starting point for the definition.
- **Inductive Step**: The rule or [[set]] of rules that describe how to generate new elements based on previously defined ones.
- **Inductive Hypothesis**: The assumption that the property holds for a certain element, which is used to prove that it holds for the next element.

## Example:

Let's define the [[set]] of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ using an inductive definition:

1. Base Case: $0 \in \mathbb{N}$
2. Inductive Step: If $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $n+1 \in \mathbb{N}$

Using this inductive definition, we can prove properties about natural numbers such as the commutative property of addition:

```java
// Commutative property of addition
int a = 3;
int b = 5;

// Base case: a + 0 = 0 + a
assert(a + 0 == 0 + a);

// Inductive step: if a + b = b + a, then (a+1) + b = b + (a+1)
assert((a+1) + b == b + (a+1));
```

By using inductive reasoning, we can extend our understanding of sets and functions beyond simple definitions and explore complex structures in mathematics and computer science.
