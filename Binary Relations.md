In mathematics, a **binary relation** on a [[set]] $A$ is a collection of ordered pairs of elements from $A$. Formally, a binary relation $R$ on $A$ is defined as a [[subset]] of the Cartesian product $A \times A$, where $(a,b) \in R$ indicates that there is a relation between elements $a$ and $b$.

## Key Theorems and Definitions

1. **Reflexive Relation**: A binary relation $R$ on [[set]] $A$ is said to be reflexive if $(a,a) \in R$ for all $a \in A$. In other words, every element in $A$ is related to itself.

2. **Symmetric Relation**: A binary relation $R$ on [[set]] $A$ is said to be symmetric if for all $(a,b) \in R$, we also have $(b,a) \in R$. This means that if $a$ is related to $b$, then $b$ is also related to $a$.

3. **Transitive Relation**: A binary relation $R$ on [[set]] $A$ is said to be transitive if for all $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in R$, we have $(a,c) \in R$. This implies that if there is a relation between two elements and another relation between the second element and a third element, then there must be a direct relation between the first and third elements.

4. **Anti-Reflexive Relation**: A binary relation $R$ on [[set]] $A$ is said to be anti-reflexive if $(a,a) \notin R$ for all $a \in A$. In other words, no element in $A$ is related to itself in the relation $R$.

5. **Anti-Symmetric Relation**: A binary relation $R$ on [[set]] $A$ is said to be anti-symmetric if for all $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,a) \in R$, where $a \neq b$, then it must be the case that $(b,a) \notin R$. This means that if $a$ is related to $b$ and $b$ is related to $a$ (where a does not equal b), then it cannot be the case that $b$ is also related to $a$.

6. **Anti-Transitive Relation**: A binary relation $R$ on [[set]] $A$ is said to be anti-transitive if for all $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in R$, we have $(a,c) \notin R$. This implies that if there are relations between two elements and between the second element and a third element, there should not be a direct relation between the first and third elements.

7. **Partial Order Relation**: A binary relation $R$ on [[set]] $A$ is said to be a partial order if it is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive. This means that every element is related to itself, if $a$ is related to $b$ then $b$ is not related to $a$ unless $a = b$, and if $a$ is related to $b$ and $b$ is related to $c$, then $a$ is also related to $c$. In other words, a partial order relation defines a partial ordering of the elements in the [[set]].

## Step-by-Step


Example

Let's consider the [[set]] $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and define a binary relation $R = \{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,2), (2,1)\}$.

1. Reflexive Check:
   - Is $(1,1) \in R$, yes.
   - Is $(2,2) \in R$, yes.
   - Is $(3,3) \in R$, yes.
   - Therefore, the relation is reflexive.

2. Symmetric Check:
   - Is $(1,2) \in R$, yes. Then check if $(2,1) \in R$, yes.
   - Therefore, the relation is symmetric.

3. Transitive Check:
   - For transitivity check: 
     - Consider $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ are in the relation.
     - Since both are related to each other directly and symmetrically,
       we can conclude that the relation is transitive as well.

### Universal Relation Example:

Let's consider the [[set]] $A = \{1, 2\}$ and define a binary relation $R = \{(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\}$.

- This relation is universal because it contains all possible pairs of elements from [[set]] $A$. It satisfies reflexivity as every element is related to itself and symmetry as all pairs have their reverse pair present in the relation.

### Always False Relation Example:

Let's consider the [[set]] $A = \{a,b,c\}$ and define a binary relation $R = \{\}$ (empty [[set]]).

- This relation is always false as it does not contain any ordered pairs. It fails to satisfy reflexivity because no element is related to itself.
