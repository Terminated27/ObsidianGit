In signal processing, the scalability property refers to how a signal changes when it is scaled by a constant factor. For continuous time signals, the scalability property can be defined as follows:

Given a continuous time signal $x(t)$, if we scale the signal by a constant factor $a$, then the scaled signal is given by $y(t) = a \cdot x(t)$.

The key theorem related to the scalability property of continuous time signals is as follows:

**Theorem:** If $x(t)$ is a continuous time signal and $a$ is a constant, then scaling the signal by $a$ results in a new signal $y(t) = a \cdot x(t)$.

This theorem highlights that scaling a continuous time signal by a constant factor simply multiplies every value of the original signal by that factor.

**Example:**

Consider a continuous time signal $x(t) = \sin(2\pi t)$. If we scale this signal by a factor of 2, then the scaled signal is given by:

$$y(t) = 2 \cdot \sin(2\pi t)$$

This means that every value of the original sine wave has been doubled in amplitude in the scaled version.

In conclusion, the scalability property of continuous time signals allows us to understand how signals behave when they are scaled by constant factors. This property is essential in various signal processing applications where manipulating the amplitude of signals is necessary.
