In signal processing, it is often necessary to analyze the even component of a given signal. The even component represents the symmetric part of the signal about the y-axis. In this atomic note, we will explore how to determine the even component of a signal using step and ramp functions.

## Definitions

Before we dive into the topic, let's define some key terms:

1. **Even function**: A function $f(x)$ is said to be even if it satisfies the property $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all values of $x$ in its domain. Geometrically, an even function is symmetric about the y-axis.

2. **[[Step function]]**: A [[step function]], denoted as $u(t)$ or $\text{step}(t)$, is defined as:

$$
u(t) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } t < 0 \\
1 & \text{if } t \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$

The [[step function]] takes on a value of 0 for negative arguments and 1 for non-negative arguments.

3. **[[Ramp function]]**: A [[ramp function]], denoted as $r(t)$ or $\text{ramp}(t)$, is defined as:

$$
r(t) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } t < 0 \\
t & \text{if } t \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$

The [[ramp function]] increases linearly with time for non-negative arguments.

## Theorems

We will now introduce two important theorems that will help us determine the even component of a signal.

### Theorem 1: Decomposition of an Even Function

Any function $f(t)$ can be decomposed into its even $(f_e(t))$ and odd $(f_o(t))$ components as follows:

$$
f(t) = f_e(t) + f_o(t)
$$

where

$$
f_e(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left(f(t) + f(-t)\right)
$$

is the even component of $f(t)$, and

$$
f_o(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left(f(t) - f(-t)\right)
$$

is the odd component of $f(t)$.

### Theorem 2: Even Component of a Signal with Step and Ramp Functions

The even component of a signal $x(t)$ can be determined by taking the average of the original signal and its time-reversed version, multiplied by a [[step function]]:

$$
x_e(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left(x(t) + x(-t)\right) u(t)
$$

where $u(t)$ is the [[step function]].

## Determining Even Component with Step and Ramp Functions: Step-by-Step Example

Let's consider an example to illustrate how to determine the even component of a signal using step and ramp functions.

**Example**: Given a signal $x(t)$ defined as:

$$
x(t) = 
\begin{cases}
t & \text{if } -1 < t < 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

We want to find the even component $x_e(t)$ of this signal.

**Step 1**: Express the given signal in terms of unit step functions.

To express the given signal in terms of unit step functions, we can rewrite it as follows:

$$
x(t) = t[u(t+1)-u(1-t)]
$$

**Step 2**: Determine the even component using Theorem 2.

Using Theorem 2, we can determine the even component $x_e(t)$ as:

$$
x_e(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left(x(t) + x(-t)\right) u(t)
$$

Substituting the expression for $x(t)$, we have:

$$
x_e(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[t[u(t+1)-u(1-t)] + (-t)[u(-t+1)-u(-1-t)]\right] u(t)
$$

Simplifying further:

$$
x_e(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[t[u(t+1)-u(1-t)] - t[u(1+t)-u(-t+1)]\right] u(t)
$$

**Step 3**: Simplify the expression.

To simplify the expression, we need to consider the properties of unit step functions. For example, $u(1+t)$ can be simplified as follows:

$$
u(1+t) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } t < -1 \\
1 & \text{if } t > -1
\end{cases}
= u(t+1)
$$

Using similar simplifications for other terms, we get:

$$
x_e(t) = \frac{t}{2} [u(t+1)-u(1-t)+u(-t+1)-u(-t-1)]
$$

Further simplification yields:

$$
x_e(t) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } t < -1 \\
\frac{t}{2} & \text{if } -11
\end{cases}
$$

## Conclusion
