The forward-backward method is an iterative optimization algorithm used to solve convex optimization problems with a specific structure. It combines the forward and backward steps to find the optimal solution. This method is particularly useful when dealing with problems that involve a sum of two functions, one of which is smooth and the other is nonsmooth.

## Algorithm

The forward-backward method can be summarized in the following steps:

1. Given an initial point $x_0$ and step size parameters $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1)$.
2. Iterate until convergence:
   - Forward step: Compute $y_k = x_k - \alpha \nabla f(x_k)$, where $f$ is the smooth component of the objective function.
   - Backward step: Compute $x_{k+1} = \text{prox}_{\alpha g}(y_k)$, where $g$ is the nonsmooth component of the objective function and $\text{prox}$ denotes the proximity operator.

## Proximity Operator

The proximity operator $\text{prox}_{\alpha g}(y)$ maps a point $y$ onto the [[set]] that minimizes the sum of a convex function $g$ and a quadratic term. It can be defined as follows:

$$
\text{prox}_{\alpha g}(y) = \arg\min_x \left(g(x) + \frac{1}{2\alpha} \|x-y\|^2\right)
$$

## Key Theorem: Convergence

Under certain conditions, the forward-backward method converges to an optimal solution of the convex optimization problem. Specifically, if $f$ is convex and differentiable, and $g$ is convex but not necessarily differentiable, then any limit point of the sequence $\{x_k\}$ generated by the algorithm satisfies:

$$
0 \in \nabla f(x) + \partial g(x)
$$

where $\nabla f(x)$ is the gradient of $f$ at $x$ and $\partial g(x)$ is the subdifferential of $g$ at $x$. This condition characterizes a stationary point of the optimization problem.

## Example: Lasso Regression

Consider the Lasso regression problem, which aims to find a sparse solution to an underdetermined linear system. The objective function can be written as:

$$
\min_x \frac{1}{2}\|Ax - b\|^2 + \lambda \|x\|_1
$$

where $A$ is a matrix, $b$ is a vector, and $\lambda > 0$ controls the sparsity of the solution. We can apply the forward-backward method to solve this problem.

In this case, $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\|Ax - b\|^2$ and $g(x) = \lambda \|x\|_1$. The gradient of $f$ is given by $\nabla f(x) = A^T(Ax - b)$, and the proximity operator of $g$ can be computed element-wise as:

$$
\text{prox}_{\alpha g}(y)_i = \text{sign}(y_i)\max(|y_i| - \alpha\lambda, 0)
$$

where $\text{sign}(y_i)$ returns the sign of $y_i$. By applying the forward-backward method iteratively, we can find a sparse solution to the Lasso regression problem.

## Conclusion

The forward-backward method provides an efficient approach for solving convex optimization problems with a sum structure. By leveraging both smooth and nonsmooth components of the objective function, it converges to an optimal solution. The method is particularly useful in applications such as sparse signal recovery, compressed sensing, and [[machine learning]].
