A block diagram is a visual representation of a system that uses blocks to represent components or processes and lines to show the relationship between these blocks. In the context of continuous time signals, block diagrams are often used to represent systems with input and output signals.

## Key Theorems and Definitions

### Theorem: [[Superposition]] Principle
The [[superposition]] principle states that the response of a linear system to a sum of multiple inputs is equal to the sum of the responses of the system to each individual input.

### Definition: [[Transfer Function]]
The [[transfer function]] of a system is defined as the ratio of the [[Laplace transform]] of the output signal to the [[Laplace transform]] of the input signal, assuming zero initial conditions.

## Step-by-Step Example

Consider a continuous-time system with [[transfer function]] $H(s)$ represented by the following block diagram:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{Input} \rightarrow \boxed{G(s)} \rightarrow \boxed{H(s)} \rightarrow \text{Output}
\end{array}
$$

where $G(s)$ represents the input signal and $H(s)$ represents the [[transfer function]]. To find the output signal in terms of $G(s)$ and $H(s)$, we can apply the [[superposition]] principle:

1. Let $Y(s)$ be the [[Laplace transform]] of the output signal.
2. By applying [[superposition]], we have:

$$
Y(s) = G(s) \cdot H(s)
$$

3. Therefore, the output signal in [[Laplace domain]] is given by $Y(s) = G(s) \cdot H(s)$.

By using block diagrams and mathematical expressions like transfer functions, we can analyze and design systems involving continuous time signals effectively.
