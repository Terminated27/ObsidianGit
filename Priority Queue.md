A priority [[queue]] is an abstract data type that stores elements along with their associated priorities. It allows adding elements with priorities and retrieving/removing the element with the highest priority. In a priority [[queue]], the element with the highest priority is always at the front of the [[queue]].

Priority queues are commonly used in various applications such as task scheduling, [[Graph]] [[algorithms]], and simulation systems.

## Key Concepts and Keywords

- Priority [[Queue]]: An abstract data type that stores elements along with their associated priorities.
- Element: The individual item stored in a priority [[queue]].
- Priority: A value associated with each element that determines its relative importance.
- Highest Priority: The element with the highest priority in the priority [[queue]].
- Insertion: Adding an element to the priority [[queue]] while maintaining its order based on priorities.
- Extraction: Removing and retrieving the element with the highest priority from the priority [[queue]].

## Implementation in [[Python]]

[[Python]] provides several ways to implement a priority [[queue]]. One common approach is to use a heapq module from [[Python]]'s standard library. The heapq module provides functions for [[heap]] operations, which can be used to create a simple yet efficient implementation of a priority [[queue]].

Here's an example of creating and using a priority [[queue]] in [[Python]]:

```python
import heapq

# Create an empty list to represent the priority queue
priority_queue = []

# Insert elements into the priority queue
heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (3, 'Task 1'))
heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (1, 'Task 2'))
heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (2, 'Task 3'))

# Retrieve and remove the element with highest priority
highest_priority = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
print(highest_priority)  # Output: (1, 'Task 2')
```

In this example, we first import the `heapq` module. Then we create an empty list `priority_queue` to represent the priority [[queue]]. We use the `heapq.heappush()` function to insert elements into the priority [[queue]]. Each element is a tuple consisting of a priority value and an associated task.

To retrieve and remove the element with the highest priority, we use the `heapq.heappop()` function. It returns the element with the highest priority based on their order in the [[heap]].

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of basic operations on a priority [[queue]] implemented using a [[binary heap]], such as insertion (`heappush()`) and extraction (`heappop()`), is logarithmic in the number of elements in the priority [[queue]] (O(log n)), where n is the number of elements.

## Conclusion

A priority [[queue]] is a useful [[data structure]] for managing elements with associated priorities. In [[Python]], you can implement a priority [[queue]] using the `heapq` module from [[Python]]'s standard library. The `heapq` module provides efficient functions for inserting and extracting elements based on their priorities.

Remember that understanding how to use a priority [[queue]] can be beneficial in solving various problems efficiently, especially in advanced programming classes where algorithmic efficiency is crucial.
