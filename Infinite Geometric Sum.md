An infinite geometric sum is the sum of an infinite sequence that follows a geometric progression. In a geometric progression, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. The formula for calculating the sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:

$$S = \frac{a}{1 - r}$$

where:
- $S$ represents the sum of the infinite series,
- $a$ is the first term of the series, and
- $r$ is the common ratio between consecutive terms.

## Theorem 1: Convergence Condition

For an infinite geometric series to converge, the absolute value of the common ratio ($|r|$) must be less than 1.

## Theorem 2: Divergence Condition

If $|r|$ is greater than or equal to 1, then the infinite geometric series diverges and does not have a finite sum.

## Example:

Consider an infinite geometric series with first term $a = 2$ and common ratio $r = \frac{1}{3}$.

To find its sum, we can use the formula:

$$S = \frac{a}{1 - r}$$

Substituting in the given values:

$$S = \frac{2}{1 - \frac{1}{3}}$$

Simplifying further:

$$S = \frac{2}{\frac{2}{3}}$$

Inverting and multiplying:

$$S = 2 \cdot \frac{3}{2}$$

Canceling out common factors:

$$S = 3$$

Therefore, in this example, the sum of the given infinite geometric series is 3.
