In mathematics, a [[set]] is said to be countable if its elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$. This means that the [[set]] can be "counted" in a way that every element is assigned a unique natural number.

## Key Theorems and Definitions

1. **Definition:** A [[set]] $A$ is countable if there exists an injective function $f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$.

2. **Theorem:** Any [[subset]] of a countable [[set]] is also countable.

3. **Theorem:** The union of countably many countable sets is countable.

4. **Definition:** A [[set]] $A$ is called at most countable if it is either finite or countably infinite.

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's consider the [[set]] of even integers $\{2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots\}$. We can define a function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots\}$ such that $f(n) = 2n$. This function is injective and covers all even integers. Therefore, the [[set]] of even integers is countably infinite.

## Conclusion

Understanding the concept of countability is crucial in various branches of mathematics, especially in analysis and [[set]] theory. By utilizing the key theorems and definitions related to countability, mathematicians can establish important results and properties about different types of sets.
