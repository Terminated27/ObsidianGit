Modulo, denoted by the symbol %, is a mathematical operation that gives the remainder when one number is divided by another. In other words, for integers $a$ and $b$ with $b \neq 0$, the modulo operation is defined as:

$$a \mod b = r$$

where $r$ is the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$. 

## Key Theorems and Definitions

### Theorem: Modulo Properties
1. **Addition**: $(a + b) \mod n = ((a \mod n) + (b \mod n)) \mod n$
2. **Multiplication**: $(a * b) \mod n = ((a \mod n) * (b \mod n)) \mod n$
3. **Exponentiation**: $(a^k) \mod n = ((a \mod n)^k) \mod n$

### Definition: Modular Arithmetic
Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain value called the modulus. It has applications in cryptography, computer science, and number theory.

## Step-by-Step Example

**Example**: Find the remainder when $17^{23}$ is divided by 7.

**Solution**:
1. Calculate $17^{23} \mod 7$ using the exponentiation property:
   $$17^{23} \equiv (17\%7)^{23} = 3^{23}$$
2. Find the remainder of $3^{23}$ when divided by 7:
   $$3^1 = 3$$
   $$3^2 = 9\%7 = 2$$
   $$3^3 = 6$$
   $$3^4 = 18\%7 = 4$$
   Continuing this pattern, we find that $3^{23} \%7 = 6$

Therefore, the remainder when $17^{23}$ is divided by 7 is 6.

Modulo operations are fundamental in various areas of mathematics and computer science, providing a way to work with remainders efficiently and effectively.
