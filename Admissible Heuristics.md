# Definition

In computer science, specifically in [[algorithms]] related to pathfinding, a [[heuristic function]] is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the [[current]] point in the path.

It is related to the concept of [[Consistent Heuristics]]. While all consistent [[heuristic]]s are admissible, not all admissible heuristics are consistent.
