#prog
-  Well-defined computational procedure
- takes a [[set]] of [[inputs]] and produces a [[set]] of values as [[output]]
- tool to solve well defined computational problem

often created in the form of programs

Correctness (what's the sum of all values in [[array]])
some have multiple solutions
some may have solutions where correctness is hard to define (like making a picture a square, which square from the picture do you choose)

Very important is time [[performance]]
### example:
an algorithm that sorts numbers from smallest to largest
[[inputs]] <41, 59, 31>
[[output]]<31, 41, 59>
