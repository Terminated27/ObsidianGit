Java is a popular object-oriented programming language that is widely used for developing various applications, ranging from simple desktop programs to complex enterprise systems. This atomic note will focus on advanced concepts and topics in Java programming, particularly relevant to an advanced programming class.

1. Inheritance:
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. The keyword used to implement inheritance in Java is `extends`. Here's an example:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking");
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `Dog` [[class]] inherits the `eat()` method from the `Animal` [[class]].

2. Polymorphism:
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and extensibility in code design. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

Method Overriding Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal is making a sound");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `makeSound()` method in the `Cat` [[class]] overrides the implementation of the same method in its superclass.

Method Overloading Example:

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    double add(double num1, double num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `add()` method is overloaded with two different parameter types.

3. Exception Handling:
Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors and exceptional situations in a program. Java provides keywords such as `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` to handle exceptions effectively.

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType1 e1) {
    // Handle exception of type ExceptionType1
} catch (ExceptionType2 e2) {
    // Handle exception of type ExceptionType2
} finally {
    // Code that always executes, regardless of exceptions
}
```

The above code demonstrates the basic structure of exception handling in Java.

4. Multithreading:
Multithreading allows concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single program. It helps in achieving better performance and responsiveness in applications. Java provides built-in support for multithreading through the `Thread` [[class]] or by implementing the `Runnable` interface.

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, a new thread is created by extending the `Thread` [[class]] and overriding the `run()` method.

5. Generics:
Generics allow classes and methods to be parameterized with types, providing type safety and reusability. They enable the creation of generic [[algorithms]] that can work with different data types.

```java
class Box<T> {
    private T content;

    void add(T item) {
        this.content = item;
    }

    T get() {
        return this.content;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Box` [[class]] is defined with a generic type parameter `T`. It can be used to hold objects of any type.

These are just a few key concepts and topics covered in an advanced Java programming class. Understanding these concepts will help you write more efficient, maintainable, and scalable Java code.
