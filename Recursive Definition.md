In a Computing & number theory class, recursive definition refers to a method of defining a function or sequence in terms of itself. This technique is commonly used in various mathematical and computational problems where the solution can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

## Key Concepts and Keywords:
- **Base case**: The [[initial condition]] or stopping point for the [[recursion]].
- **Recursive case**: The step that breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems.
- **[[Recursion]]**: The process of solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem.

## Explanation:
A recursive definition typically consists of two parts: a base case and a recursive case. The base case provides the termination condition for the [[recursion]], while the recursive case defines how to break down the problem into simpler instances until reaching the base case.

### Example: Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of a recursively defined sequence. It is defined as follows:

$$
F(n) = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } n = 0 \\
1 & \text{if } n = 1 \\
F(n-1) + F(n-2) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

This recursive definition states that the nth Fibonacci number is equal to the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers, with base cases F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

### Code Example in Java:
```java
public int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else if (n == 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the `fibonacci` function uses [[recursion]] to calculate the nth Fibonacci number based on the recursively defined formula.

By understanding and applying recursive definitions effectively, students can solve complex problems efficiently in computing and number theory classes.
