[[data structure]] are fundamental components of computer science and programming that organize and store data efficiently. They enable the manipulation, retrieval, and management of data. Common [[data structure]] include [[array|arrays]], [[linked lists]], [[Stack]], [[queue]], [[tree]], [[Graph]], and [[hash table]]. The choice of a [[data structure]] depends on the specific problem and the operations that need to be performed on the data. Efficient [[data structure]] selection is crucial for optimizing [[algorithms]] and solving complex computational problems.


representation and organization of [[data]]
what do you expect from a good data structure?
- [[Performance]]
- able to manage [[big data]]

quality of data structure depends on operation
- unsorted pile of papers
	- very fast at adding an item
	- slow at finding a certain item
- papers sorted by last names
	- slow to add item
	- faster for finding item
	- still slow if search by first name
