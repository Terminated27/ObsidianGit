A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that allows [[current]] to flow in only one direction. It is commonly used in various circuits for rectification, [[voltage]] regulation, and signal modulation. In this note, we will discuss the behavior of diodes in different circuit configurations and explore some key theorems and definitions related to diode circuits.

## Diode Characteristics

Before diving into diode circuits, let's briefly review the characteristics of a diode. The [[current]]-[[voltage]] relationship of an ideal diode can be described by the [[Shockley diode equation]]:

$$I_D = I_S \left(e^{\frac{V_D}{nV_T}} - 1\right)$$

where:
- $I_D$ is the diode [[current]],
- $I_S$ is the [[reverse saturation current]],
- $V_D$ is the [[voltage]] across the diode,
- $n$ is the ideality factor (typically around 1 for silicon diodes),
- $V_T$ is the [[thermal voltage]] ($\frac{kT}{q}$), where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is temperature in Kelvin, and $q$ is the charge of an electron.

## Diode Circuit Configurations

### 1. Forward Bias

When a positive [[voltage]] is applied to the [[anode]] (p-side) and negative [[voltage]] to the [[cathode]] (n-side) of a diode, it is said to be forward biased. In this configuration, if $V_D > 0$, then according to Shockley's equation, [[current]] will flow through the diode.

### 2. Reverse Bias

When a negative [[voltage]] is applied to the anode and positive [[voltage]] to the cathode of a diode, it is said to be reverse biased. In this configuration, if $V_D < 0$, then according to Shockley's equation, the diode [[current]] will be negligible.

## Step-by-Step Example: Diode Rectifier Circuit

Let's consider a simple example of a diode rectifier circuit, which converts [[alternating current]] (AC) into [[direct current]] (DC). The circuit consists of an AC source connected in series with a [[resistor]] and a diode.

1. Apply an AC [[voltage]] with peak amplitude $V_{\text{peak}}$ across the series combination of the [[resistor]] and diode.
2. During the positive half-cycle of AC, when $V_{\text{peak}} > 0$, the diode is forward biased and conducts [[current]] according to Shockley's equation.
3. The [[voltage]] drop across the [[resistor]] ($V_R$) can be calculated using [[Ohm's Law]]: $V_R = I_D \cdot R$, where $R$ is the resistance.
4. During the negative half-cycle of AC, when $V_{\text{peak}} < 0$, the diode is reverse biased and blocks [[current]] flow.
5. The output across the [[resistor]] will be a rectified waveform, with only the positive half-cycles passing through.

This example illustrates how a diode rectifier circuit can convert AC to DC by allowing [[current]] flow in only one direction.

In conclusion, diodes play a crucial role in various electronic circuits. Understanding their behavior in different configurations and applying fundamental laws like KVL, KCL, and [[Ohm's Law]] can help analyze and design diode circuits effectively.
