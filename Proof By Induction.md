Proof by induction is a powerful technique used in mathematics, particularly in the field of number theory, to prove statements about natural numbers. In the context of computing and number theory classes, proof by induction is often used to establish the correctness of [[algorithms]] or properties of data structures.

## Key Concepts

- **Base Case**: The first step in an inductive proof is to establish that the statement holds for a base case, typically the smallest natural number for which the statement should be true.
- **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary natural number $n=k$.
- **Inductive Step**: Show that if the statement holds for $n=k$, then it also holds for $n=k+1$.

## Example

Let's consider the following statement:

$$
1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

We will prove this statement using induction.

### Base Case
For $n=1$, we have:

$$
1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2}
$$

which is true.

### Inductive Hypothesis
Assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary $n=k$:

$$
1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
$$

### Inductive Step
We need to show that if the statement holds for $n=k$, then it also holds for $n=k+1$. Adding $(k+1)$ to both sides of our assumption gives:

$$
\begin{align*}
1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + k + (k+1) &= \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) \\
&= \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2} \\
&= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \\
&= \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2}
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, by induction, the original statement is proven.

    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
