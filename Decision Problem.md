## Definition
In computer science, a **decision problem** is a problem that requires a yes-or-no answer. It is a question in the form of "Does there exist an input for which the output satisfies a certain property?" Decision problems are fundamental in computational complexity theory and serve as building blocks for more complex computational tasks.

## Key Concepts and Keywords
- Decision problem: A problem that requires a yes-or-no answer.
- Computational complexity theory: The study of the resources required to solve computational problems.
- Input: The data provided to the problem.
- Output: The result or solution to the problem.
- Property: A characteristic or condition that the output must satisfy.
- Yes-or-no answer: A binary response indicating whether the property holds for at least one input.

## Example

Let's consider an example related to a [[Python]] advanced programming class. Suppose we have a list of integers and we want to determine if there exists an element in the list that is divisible by 5.

```python
def has_divisible_by_5(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 5 == 0:
            return True
    return False

numbers = [10, 7, 15, 3, 8]
result = has_divisible_by_5(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

In this example, we define a function `has_divisible_by_5` that takes a list of numbers as input. It iterates over each number in the list and checks if it is divisible by 5 using the [[modulo]] operator `%`. If it finds such an element, it returns `True`, indicating that there exists at least one number divisible by 5. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The decision problem here is whether there exists an element in the given list that satisfies the property of being divisible by 5. The output of the function provides a yes-or-no answer to this problem.

## Conclusion
Decision problems are fundamental in computer science and play a crucial role in various areas, including algorithm design, computational complexity analysis, and artificial intelligence. Understanding decision problems helps programmers tackle complex computational tasks by breaking them down into simpler yes-or-no questions. In the example provided, we demonstrated how to solve a decision problem related to finding a divisible element in a list of numbers using [[Python]] programming.
