[[Set]] algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the manipulation and properties of sets. Sets are collections of distinct objects, and [[set]] algebra involves operations such as union, intersection, complement, and Cartesian product.

## Key Concepts

### Union

The union of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cup B$, is the [[set]] of all elements that are in either $A$ or $B$ or both.

$$ A \cup B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \} $$

### Intersection

The intersection of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \cap B$, is the [[set]] of all elements that are in both $A$ and $B$.

$$ A \cap B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \} $$

### Complement

The complement of a [[set]] $A$ with respect to a universal [[set]] $U$, denoted by $A'$ or $\bar{A}$, is the [[set]] of all elements in $U$ that are not in $A$.

$$ A' = U - A = \{ x : x \in U \text{ and } x\not\in A\} $$

### Cartesian Product

The Cartesian product of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\times B$, is the [[set]] of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$.

$$ A\times B = \{(a,b) : a\in A, b\in B\} $$

## Theorems

### Distributive Laws
1. **Union over Intersection**: 
   $$ A\cup(B\cap C) = (A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C) $$

2. **Intersection over Union**:
   $$ A\cap(B\cup C) = (A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C) $$

### De Morgan's Laws
1. **Complement of Union**:
   $$ (A\cup B)' = A'\cap B' $$

2. **Complement of Intersection**:
   $$ (A\cap B)' = A'\cup B' $$

## Example
Let's consider three sets: 
- [[Set]] 1: $A=\{1,2,3,4\}$ 
- [[Set]] 2: $B=\{3,4,5,6\}$ 
- [[Set]] 3: $C=\{4,5,6,7\}$ 

Find:
1. $A∪(B∩C)$
   
   First find $B∩C$ which is ${4}$. Then find $A∪(B∩C)= {1,2,3,4} ∪ {4}= {1,2,3,4}$.

2. $A∩(B∪C)$
   
   First find $B∪C$ which is ${3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7}$. Then find $A∩(B∪C)= {1 ,2 ,3 ,4} ∩ {3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7}= {3 ,4}$.
