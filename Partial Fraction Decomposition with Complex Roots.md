[[Partial Fraction Decomposition]] is a method used to simplify rational functions by breaking them down into simpler fractions. When the denominator of the rational function has complex roots, the decomposition involves using [[complex numbers]] in the partial fractions.

## Key Theorems and Definitions

1. **[[Complex Conjugate]] [[Root]] Theorem**: If a polynomial has a complex [[root]] $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, then its conjugate $a - bi$ is also a [[root]].

2. **[[Partial Fraction Decomposition]]**: Given a rational function $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, where $Q(x)$ can be factored into linear and irreducible quadratic factors, we can express it as a sum of partial fractions:
$$
\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{A_i}{(x - r_i)} + \frac{B_i x + C_i}{(x^2 + px + q_i)} \right)
$$
where $r_i$ are real roots and $p$, $q_i$ are coefficients of irreducible quadratic factors.

## Step-by-Step Example


Let's consider the rational function:
$$
\frac{2x^2 + 3x + 1}{x^2 + x + 1}
$$

1. Factorize the denominator:
$$
x^2 + x + 1 = (x - (-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i))(x - (-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i))
$$

2. Write the [[partial fraction decomposition]] as:
$$
\frac{2x^2 + 3x + 1}{x^2 + x + 1} = \frac{A(x - (-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i))}{(x - (-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i))} + \frac{B(x - (-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i))}{(x - (-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i))}
$$

3. Multiply both sides by the denominator to clear fractions:
$$
(2x^2 + 3x + 1) = A(x - (-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i)) + B(x - (-\frac {1}{2}-\frac {\sqrt {3}} { 20 } i))
$$

4. Solve for $A$ and $B$ by comparing coefficients of like terms.

5. Finally, substitute the values of $A$ and $B$ back into the [[partial fraction decomposition]] to get the simplified form of the rational function.

By following these steps, we can decompose a rational function with complex roots into simpler fractions using [[Partial Fraction Decomposition]].
