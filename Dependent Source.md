**Definition:** Dependent sources are essential components in electrical circuits whose values ([[current]] or [[voltage]]) depend on the [[voltage]] or [[current]] in other parts of the circuit. Unlike independent sources, their output is controlled by the [[voltage]] or [[current]] in the circuit, making them versatile and powerful elements in circuit design.

**Types of Dependent Sources:**

1. **[[Voltage]]-Controlled [[Voltage]] Source (VCVS):**
    
    - [[Voltage]] output is proportional to a controlling [[voltage]] in the circuit.
    - Equation: $V_{out}=A*V_{control}$, where $A$ is the [[voltage]] gain.
2. **[[Current]]-Controlled [[Voltage]] Source (CCVS):**
    
    - [[Voltage]] output is proportional to a controlling [[current]] in the circuit.
    - Equation: $V_{out}=R*I_{control}$​, where $R$ is the [[transconductance]] factor.
3. **[[Voltage]]-Controlled [[Current]] Source (VCCS):**
    
    - [[Current]] output is proportional to a controlling [[voltage]] in the circuit.
    - Equation: $I_{out}=G*V_{control}$​, where $G$ is the [[transresistance]] factor.
4. **[[Current]]-Controlled [[Current]] Source (CCCS):**
    
    - [[Current]] output is proportional to a controlling [[current]] in the circuit.
    - Equation: $V_{out}=H*I_{control}$​, where $H$ is the [[current]] gain.

**Key Points:**

- **Versatility:** Dependent sources enable engineers to model complex circuit behaviors, making them indispensable in various applications, including amplifiers, oscillators, and control systems.
    
- **Mathematical Representations:** Dependent sources are represented mathematically using gain constants (A, R, G, H) that relate the output quantity to the controlling quantity.
    
- **Analysis and Design:** Understanding dependent sources is crucial for analyzing and designing circuits, especially in fields like electronics and electrical engineering.
    
- **Application:** Dependent sources find applications in active filters, operational amplifiers, and systems involving feedback loops, where their behavior is contingent upon specific circuit conditions.
